      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because in context, sharing \"similarities with\" means having some resemblance to. The text establishes a comparison between two groups of mammals, stating that although they aren't closely related, hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs play similar roles in their habitats, a circumstance that has resulted in the independent development of some of the same physical traits. This context supports the idea that hedgehog tenrecs resemble, or share basic similarities with, true hedgehogs in some respects.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that hedgehog tenrecs are \"examples of,\" or representative of, true hedgehogs. The text states despite some shared physical traits, the two groups of mammals aren't closely related; therefore, hedgehog tenrecs can't be examples of true hedgehogs. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"concerns about\" would mean worries about or interests in. The text focuses on the various physical traits that hedgehog tenrecs and true hedgehogs share. There's nothing in the text to suggest why hedgehog tenrecs would be worried about true hedgehogs, or why they would be interested in them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"indications of\" would mean evidence of. By listing a set of traits that hedgehog tenrecs share with true hedgehogs, the text establishes a comparison between the two groups of mammals, and saying that the traits shared within one group of mammals provide evidence of another group of mammals wouldn't be an effective way to establish the similarities between the two groups.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Yaszek's introduction to her science fiction anthology. In this context \"overtly\" means openly or without concealment. The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in women-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science fiction from the 1970s. This contrast implies that the work from the 1970s did clearly reflect feminist political themes. In other words, the text indicates that unlike women who wrote science fiction in the 1920s to the 1960s, the women who wrote science fiction in the 1970s expressed overtly feminist themes.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context \"prudently\" would mean cautiously, which might plausibly describe the women who wrote science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s, in that they tended to avoid revealing their political views; however, the text contrasts these authors with the women writing science fiction in the 1970s, thereby suggesting that the authors writing in the 1970s were not restrained in that way. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"cordially\" would mean politely, and nothing in the text indicates that politeness was a significant factor for women writing science fiction either from the 1920s to the 1960s or in the 1970s. The text draws a contrast between the lack of \"deliberately signaled\" political themes in women-authored science fiction from the 1920s to the 1960s and what Yaszek notes about women-authored science fiction from the 1970s. It's unclear how \"less deliberately signaled\" politics and an increasing sense of politeness toward feminism would constitute a meaningful contrast. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"inadvertently\" would mean unintentionally, and nothing in the text suggests that Yaszek thought the feminist elements of the women-authored science fiction from the 1970s arose without deliberate effort.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion about research into social media use. In context, \"redressing\" means remedying or compensating for. The text indicates that there is a long-standing trend of overemphasizing teenagers and young adults in studies of social media use. It goes on to say that scholars have recently broadened the kinds of social media users they study by including senior citizens. This suggests that scholars are redressing the long-standing trend of overemphasis on younger users by studying older users as well.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"exacerbating\" means making worse or aggravating, which would not make logical sense in context. Expanding the focus of studies of social media use to include senior citizens would not make the long-standing trend of overemphasizing teenagers and young adults in studies of social media use worse; instead, it would help to remedy this trend. Choice C is incorrect because \"epitomizing\" means illustrating or providing an example, which would not make logical sense in context. Expanding the groups of social media users that scholars study to include senior citizens would not provide an example of the long-standing trend of overemphasizing teenagers and young people in research on social media use. Choice D is incorrect because \"precluding\" means making impossible in advance or preventing, which would not make logical sense in context. The text indicates that there is a long-standing trend of overemphasizing teenagers and young adults in social media research. Expanding the focus of social media research to include senior citizens, as the text indicates scholars have begun to do, could help to rectify the trend, but it could not prevent the trend or make the trend impossible in advance, since the trend started long before scholars started expanding their focus.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because as used in the text, \"disputing\" most nearly means providing resistance to. The narrator is in a taxi as it drives down a street lined with so many food vendors and shoppers that the narrator describes them as \"the multitude of Paris,\" meaning an immense group of people. The street is essentially a large open-air market, and there are so many people pushing small wagons of goods and carrying shopping baskets that \"every inch\" of the taxi's progress is impeded. In other words, the people are providing resistance to the taxi's attempt to drive down the street.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean arguing, the narrator doesn't portray the shoppers and vendors as arguing with the driver of the taxi or, indeed, arguing at all. Choice B is incorrect. Although in some contexts, \"disputing\" can mean expressing disapproval, the narrator doesn't suggest that the shoppers and vendors necessarily disapprove of the taxi's attempt to drive down the street. Instead, their combined presence along the street has the effect of impeding the taxi's progress. Choice C is incorrect because, as the narrator explains, both the multitude of people and the taxi are using a public space (a street) at the same time. The narrator doesn't go so far as to suggest that the people feel that they, and not the taxi, possess exclusive access to the street.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the twelfth-century Islamic philosopher Ibn Rushd. As used in this context, \"inconsequential to\" means not significant to. According to the text, Ibn Rushd's works were primarily available in Spain, where he lived, far from central areas of the Muslim world, a fact that could support the conclusion that his influence on Muslim contemporaries was limited. The text implies, however, that recent scholarship has shown that his works still had an impact on other Muslim philosophers of his time. This context supports the idea that his works weren't inconsequential to Islamic thought in this period.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the issue under consideration in the text is whether other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd's time had access to his works, not whether his works were \"controversial among,\" or causing dispute among, other philosophers. Choice B is incorrect. The text implies that other Muslim philosophers of Ibn Rushd's era were aware of his works, not that they were \"antagonistic toward,\" or hostile toward, them. There is no suggestion that Ibn Rushd's writings elicited hostility from his contemporaries. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"imitated by\" would mean followed as a model by. Although the text implies that Ibn Rushd's works were at least somewhat available in regions that were at the center of Islamic thought during the period, it doesn't specifically address in what ways his works influenced contemporary Muslim philosophers. Thus, the text doesn't support the idea that other philosophers modeled their own works after Ibn Rushd's works.",

The second sentence is underlined and gives more detail about this stylistic change, noting that his earlier work consisted largely of landscapes in an expressionist style and his new works were highly stylized portraits of Black Americans. In other words, the function of the underlined sentence is to elaborate on a transitional moment in Johnson's painting career.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text does mention that Johnson spent a decade in Europe, it does not discuss what other travel Johnson might have done. Furthermore, although the text mentions African, American, and Scandinavian artistic elements in Johnson's work, it does not indicate that he traveled to different locations to learn about these practices. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not focus on Johnson's personal life nor does it address how successful his career was in general. Choice D is incorrect because, rather than call it into question, the underlined sentence continues the discussion of Johnson's career by adding further relevant detail of Johnson's artistic transformation.",

It goes on to point out that despite her skill and experience, Argerich works tirelessly and treats each piece of music as if it is new each time she performs it, and that it is this preparation that causes her playing to appear relaxed and natural.

      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it best describes the function of the underlined portion in the text as a whole. The text describes the failed attempt of Israel Potter to establish a farm in New England during the late eighteenth century: according to his contract, he was to receive two hundred acres in exchange for three months' work, but his employer then refused to fulfill the bargain and Israel had no recourse to law to obtain the land he was owed. Israel was therefore forced to find another means of supporting himself. To explain why Israel was particularly susceptible to his employer's dishonesty, the underlined portion states that though Israel was \"brave-hearted, and even much of a dare-devil upon a pinch,\" he also possessed \"a singular patience and mildness.\" In other words, Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, but he was usually meek and disinclined to argument, from which it is reasonable to infer that Israel was often taken advantage of. Thus, the underlined portion suggests that if not for a certain aspect of his character, Israel might not have been as easily thwarted in his ambition to establish a farm.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because although the underlined portion describes aspects of Israel's personality, it does not address how he feels about his own personality. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion addresses Israel's occasional courage and frequent meekness but does not address whether he would have the skills and resolve necessary to operate a farm if he owned sufficient property. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does indicate that Israel could be courageous in certain circumstances, it does not say that he undertook acts of courage that others avoided, but rather that he was habitually meek. Even if the underlined portion did say that Israel was more courageous than most, this would not explain why he found himself under the circumstances described in the text—that is, as a consequence of his meek nature, cheated of the property to which he had a right.",

It has since become a tradition for hundreds of dance companies in North America to stage \\textit{The Nutcracker} each year. But \\underline{the show is stuck in the past, with an old-fashioned story and references, so it should no longer be produced}. Ballet needs to create new traditions if it wants to stay relevant to contemporary audiences.\n\nText 2\n\\textit{The Nutcracker} is outdated, but it should be kept because it's a holiday favorite and provides substantial income for some dance companies. Although it can be behind the times, there are creative ways to update the show. For example, Debbie Allen successfully modernized the story. Her show \\textit{Hot Chocolate Nutcracker} combines ballet, tap, hip-hop, and other styles, and it has been gaining in popularity since it opened in 2009.\n\nBased on the texts, how would the author of Text 2 most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1?",

Text 1 begins by noting the success of \\textit{The Nutcracker} but then claims that the ballet is \"stuck in the past\" and should \"no longer be produced.\" Text 2 begins by conceding that \\textit{The Nutcracker} is indeed outdated but argues that it should continue to be performed, states that the show can be updated to include more contemporary dance styles, and provides an example of one such modernized version, \\textit{Hot Chocolate Nutcracker}. Hence, the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the underlined claim in Text 1 by suggesting that dance companies should consider offering revised versions of \\textit{The Nutcracker} instead of completely rejecting the show.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 advocates for using creative ways to update \\textit{The Nutcracker} and therefore wouldn't respond to the underlined claim by rejecting the suggestion that contemporary audiences would enjoy an updated version. Choice B is incorrect because although the authors of both texts claim that \\textit{The Nutcracker} is outdated, neither text suggests that contemporary audiences have largely stopped attending productions of the show. On the contrary, Text 2 states that \\textit{The Nutcracker} is a holiday favorite and generates substantial income for some dance companies. Choice C is incorrect because although Text 2 provides an example of a contemporized version of \\textit{The Nutcracker}, the text doesn't suggest that offering modernized versions is a way to increase income for most dance companies. Rather, the author of Text 2 suggests that offering modernized versions is a way to make the ballet discussed in Text 1 feel less outdated.",

The text states that the researchers explain that a change in layout causes shoppers to hunt for items' new locations, which exposes the shoppers to more products and increases the likelihood that they'll make an unplanned purchase.

Instead of attributing an unplanned purchase to a change in layout, the quotation notes that the shopper searched for but couldn't find some items, and as a result the shopper purchased less, not more, than what was anticipated. Choice C is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to coupons that the shopper received, not to a new store layout. Thus, the quotation doesn't support the researchers' explanation that rearranging a store's layout can lead shoppers to make unanticipated purchases. Choice D is incorrect because the quotation attributes what was purchased to the size and stock of the store, not to a new store layout. The shopper simply purchased products that the shopper wanted in a particular store because other stores didn't carry those products, so the quotation doesn't support the researchers' explanation that rearranging a store's layout can lead shoppers to make spontaneous purchases.",

According to the text, the researchers' study design included a group of employees who took no leave, a group who took 2-4 days of leave, and a group who took 1-5 weeks of leave. The participants who took leave were tested for attentiveness one week before their leave (the first test administration), one week after their return to work (the second test administration), and two weeks after their return (the third test administration). The participants who took no leave were tested three times at random. The graph shows that at one week after their return to work, participants who took only 2-4 days of leave had an average attentiveness score of between 540 and 600, while participants who took 1-5 weeks of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540. At two weeks after their return to work, those who took only 2-4 days of leave had an average score of between 480 and 540, while those who took 1-5 weeks of leave had an average score of approximately 480. In other words, the graph shows that on both post-leave testing dates, participants with longer leave times had lower average attentiveness scores than those with shorter leave times. Since attentiveness is an indicator of cognitive functioning, these data confirm Packer and colleagues' conclusion that longer leave times might not confer a greater cognitive benefit than shorter leave times do.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The graph does show that in the second test administration, participants who took 2- 4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave and also shows that in the third test administration, those who took no leave had higher average scores than those who took 1-5 weeks of leave. But neither of these findings has a direct bearing on the researchers' conclusion, which concerns a comparison of participants who took 2-4 days of leave with those who took 1-5 weeks, rather than a comparison of either group with participants who took no leave. Choice B is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the first test administration, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had lower average attentiveness scores than did those who took 1-5 weeks of leave and those who took no leave, this test administration occurred before any participants went on leave; therefore, these results have no bearing on the researchers' conclusion about how the amount of leave taken by participants affected their cognitive functioning. Choice D is incorrect. Although the graph does show that in the second and third test administrations, participants who took 2-4 days of leave had higher average attentiveness scores than did those who took no leave, the researchers' conclusion is about the effects of short leave compared with the effects of long leave, not the effects of short leave compared with the effects of no leave. These results are therefore irrelevant to the conclusion.",

According to the text, moving at maximal speed (the highest speed possible) requires so much energy that it is not always an effective strategy for animals, even when they are escaping predators. The graph displays data on the average percent of maximal speed used by lizard species while either escaping predators or pursuing prey. The graph categorizes the data for both pursuing and escaping by the number of species using 30%-39% of maximal speed, 40%-49% of maximal speed, 50%-59% of maximal speed, 60%-69% of maximal speed, 70%-79% of maximal speed, 80%-89% of maximal speed, and 90%-100% of maximal speed, respectively. In the graph, there is at least one species in each of the following percent categories for maximal speed while escaping predators: 50%-59%, 60%-69%, 70%-79%, and 80%-89%. Thus, the data in the graph show that multiple lizard species move at an average of less than 90% of their maximal speed while escaping predation.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the data in the graph isn't organized in such a way that a comparison of the percentage of maximal speed used when escaping predation with the percentage used when pursuing prey is possible at the level of individual species. Choice C is incorrect. It is true that in the graph, the percent category with the largest number of species using maximal speed while escaping predators is 90%-100% (8 species total). However, these data don't complete the text, which is concerned instead with how animals are discouraged from using maximal speed even when escaping predators because of the amount of energy required to use it. Choice D is incorrect because these data from the graph pertain to maximal speed while pursuing prey and therefore don't complete the text's discussion of lizard species' use of maximal speed when escaping predators.",

Extreme high pressure, such as can be found in deep ocean waters, destabilizes these bonds and compresses water's structure, allowing water molecules within organisms to permeate proteins and impede crucial biological functions; yet deep-sea organisms known as piezophiles have adapted to extreme pressure. Studies have found a positive correlation between the depths that various piezophiles inhabit and concentrations of a compound called trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) in their muscle tissues, which has led a team of researchers to hypothesize that TMAO reduces water's compressibility.\n\nWhich finding, if true, would most directly support the researchers' hypothesis?",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers' hypothesis that TMAO reduces water's compressibility. The text explains that at great depths in the ocean, extreme pressure compresses the molecular structure of water by destabilizing the hydrogen bonds between adjacent molecules, thereby allowing water to penetrate proteins and harm the associated organisms. However, deep-sea organisms called piezophiles have adapted to live at these depths and previous studies show a positive correlation between the depth at which a piezophile species lives and the species' level of the compound TMAO. Because this hypothesis links TMAO levels with reduced compressibility of water's tetrahedral molecular structure, a finding that TMAO helps maintain the hydrogen bonds between water molecules under high pressure would strongly support that hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the researchers' hypothesis suggests a relationship between TMAO and water molecules' tetrahedral molecular structure, that relationship involves TMAO helping maintain water's tetrahedral molecular structure under high pressure; as presented in the text, the hypothesis doesn't contend that water molecules are impervious to, or incapable of being penetrated by, TMAO. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses how the molecular structure of water, not TMAO, is compressed under extreme pressure and never addresses how TMAO might be affected by such pressure. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers' hypothesis holds that water under extreme pressure is more resistant, not less, to being compressed when TMAO concentrations are higher. Moreover, the positive correlation mentioned in the text is between TMAO concentrations and the depths at which piezophiles live, not between concentrations of TMAO and the rate at which water's molecular structure compresses as pressure increases.",

The text first describes what paleontologists initially speculated to be true of \\textit{T. navigans} based on observing only fossilized skulls of the pterosaur rather than complete skeletons—namely, that \\textit{T. navigans} had an oversized head crest and that, like other pterosaurs, its main mode of movement must have been flight. The text goes on to describe what researcher Victor Beccari and his team concluded based on studying a nearly complete fossilized skeleton of \\textit{T. navigans}, which provided additional information that fossilized skulls alone could not. Beccari and colleagues determined that \\textit{T. navigans} had long hind legs, short wings, and an unusually long neck, in addition to the oversized head crest previously observed by paleontologists. Taken together, these characteristics would have made sustained flight difficult and upright walking comfortable, which would make \\textit{T. navigans} different from other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Thus, Beccari and colleagues suggest that previously held speculations of paleontologists are inaccurate: that instead of moving mainly through powered flight, \\textit{T. navigans} likely flew for shorter distances and spent more time walking than researchers previously thought.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because Beccari and his team determined, based on their examination of a nearly complete skeleton, that \\textit{T. navigans} would have found \"sustained flight difficult,\" which would differentiate it from most other pterosaurs that moved mainly through flight. Therefore, Beccari's team would not suggest that \\textit{T. navigans} flew for longer distances than did other pterosaur species with large head crests. Choice B is incorrect because the fossilized skeleton studied by Beccari and colleagues was notable for its short wings, and because no indication in the text is made that other pterosaurs were thought by paleontologists to be comfortable walking. Therefore, Beccari's team would not suggest that \\textit{T. navigans} had longer wings than other pterosaur species considered to have been comfortable walking. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Beccari and his team agree with the paleontologists mentioned earlier in the text that \\textit{T. navigans} had a large-crested head. Therefore, Beccari's team would not suggest that \\textit{T. navigans} had a smaller head than researchers previously expected.",

According to the text, ethical consumers are people who strive to purchase goods and services with positive or neutral effects on society and the environment. The text explains that consumer psychologists believe these consumers are more likely to purchase a product if its effects correspond better to their values. The text then introduces a study of ethical consumers' attitudes toward a specific mobile phone, indicating that participants in their twenties had a less positive attitude toward the phone's effects on society and the environment than participants in other age groups did. The text indicates that readers should assume there are no other differences between the participants in their twenties and those in other age groups. If the consumer psychologists' theory is correct, as the text proposes, then the study's finding suggests that ethical consumers in their twenties are less likely to purchase the phone than ethical consumers in other age groups are.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text mentions only the mobile phone used in the study and therefore provides no basis to compare participants' attitudes toward that phone with their attitudes toward any other phone.

If the consumer psychologists' theory is true, as the text proposes, then the study's finding suggests that ethical consumers in their twenties are meaningfully less likely to purchase the phone than ethical consumers in other age groups are. Choice D is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that ethical consumers in their twenties are more likely than ethical consumers in other age groups to consider a phone's social and ecological effects when deciding whether to purchase it.

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ester Hernandez's art. In this context, \"featured\" means shown prominently. The text focuses on where Hernandez's works have been and continue to be displayed, explaining that her early works, which consisted of murals, could be viewed in outdoor spaces in San Francisco. The central contrast developed in the text is between where her early works could be viewed and where her works can be viewed now, which is in museums across the United States and around the world. The context therefore supports the idea that Hernandez's works are now shown, or featured, in museums globally.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"invented\" would mean created something for the first time, which isn't supported since the text doesn't discuss where Hernandez creates her works or whether they're original or innovative. Choice B is incorrect because \"adjusted\" in this context would mean adapted. Although the text mentions that many of Hernandez's early works were outdoor murals and thus it may be reasonable to infer that Hernandez altered her approach to creating art so that her works could be displayed in indoor venues instead, the text makes no mention of how Hernandez's works might have been adapted for such venues. The text focuses on where Hernandez's works have been and continue to be displayed, not on how she or anyone else may have adapted, or adjusted, her works. Choice D is incorrect because \"recommended\" in this context would mean endorsed or put forth as a suggestion for something that is worth seeing. Although it may be reasonable to say that in choosing to display certain works, museum curators believe such works are worth seeing, the text doesn't discuss the reasons why museums display Hernandez's works. Instead, the text mainly develops a contrast between where Hernandez's early works could once be viewed and where her work can be viewed now.",

In this context, \"inspired by\" means influenced by or motivated by. The text refers to how, regardless of the scale of the work, Garza uses her memories of Texas and details from California to create her art. If Garza is basing her work on her direct experiences, then they play a part in her artistic process. This context thus suggests that Garza's art is inspired by the experiences of her childhood in Texas and her current life in California.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make logical sense to indicate that Garza is \"complimented by\"—or praised by—something inanimate such as direct experience. Choice B is incorrect because describing Garza as \"uncertain about\"—or unsure or doubtful of—direct experience would suggest that she had misgivings about it. If Garza were unsure of her experiences, that would suggest that she couldn't recall them, and Garza wouldn't be able to represent direct experience in her art if she were uncertain of the memories or details. Choice C is incorrect because describing Garza as \"unbothered by\"—or uninterested in—her experience would imply the opposite of what the text suggests about Garza's artistic process. The text indicates that Garza's art comes from memories of her childhood in Texas and details of her surroundings in California.",

In this context, \"accidental\" means unplanned or unintentional. The text first describes Bastos's study, which concerns a kea that is observed using small stones to preen its feathers. The text then mentions colleagues who are skeptical (that is, they have doubt) about Bastos's findings, and finally describes how Bastos and her team responded to the skepticism of those colleagues. Given that the colleagues mentioned in the text expressed skepticism regarding Bastos's findings, the best answer choice must be one that completes the text in a manner such that the skeptics' opinion regarding the kea's use of stones disagrees with that held by Bastos and her team. Since Bastos and her team showed that the kea's use of stones was deliberate (that is, intentional), the skeptics' opinion in this context must be that the kea's use of stones was unintentional, or accidental.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the best answer choice is one that portrays skepticism, or doubt, of Bastos's claim that the kea's usage of stones was deliberate, or intentional. If the skeptics found the kea's usage of stones \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, this would not be at odds with the position of Bastos and her team; in fact, it is reasonable to believe that someone who agreed that the kea's stone usage was deliberate would also find it intriguing. Choice B is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea's usage of small stones was \"obvious,\" or evident, this would not be contrary to the observation of Bastos and her team that the kea's usage of stones was deliberate: in fact, these opinions would be consistent with each other. Choice D is incorrect because if the skeptics believed that the kea's usage of small stones was \"observable,\" or visible, this would not conflict with the claim of Bastos and her team that the kea's usage of stones was deliberate: instead, these positions would agree.",

The text notes the similarity between those methods, which include the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation, and methods used in the creation of medieval manuscripts. This context suggests that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is apparent from, or manifest in, the methods and materials his company employed.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is \"insensible to,\" or unaware of or lacking perception of, the use of handmade materials and intricate ornamentation in the production of the Kelmscott editions. Instead, the text suggests that the methods and materials used to produce the Kelmscott editions are evidence of Morris's repudiation of industrialization.

Although creating the Kelmscott editions may have involved examining the books closely, the text does not mention this aspect of Morris's work, and in any case, the action of using certain materials to create those editions cannot scrutinize Morris's attitude toward industrialization. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Morris's repudiation of industrialization is \"complicated by,\" or made more complex or difficult by, the Kelmscott Press's use of preindustrial methods and handcrafted elements to produce books.

The text indicates that to achieve this aim, Francie works systematically and persistently: she reads all the books in the library in alphabetical order and devotes much time and effort to the project, finishing one book per day over a long period of time. The text then suggests that even though she progresses slowly (\"she was still in the B's\") and that she struggled with some books (\"some of the B's had been hard going\"), she doesn't give up because she thinks of herself as \"a reader.\" These details show Francie's resolve.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text mentions several topics (bees and buffaloes, Bermuda vacations, and Byzantine architecture) that Francie has read about, it doesn't indicate that any of these topics are unusual or that she especially enjoyed reading about one of these topics in particular. If anything, the text suggests that she may have found some of these topics to be dull, saying that she even read the \"dry ones\"— that is, the boring books—and that some of the books were \"hard going,\" meaning they were difficult to get through. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss Francie's involvement in other activities, only her dedication to reading.

The text then describes an experiment conducted by an anthropologist to test this hypothesis.

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most effectively describes the function of the underlined portion. The text discusses the long-standing misconception that people in medieval Europe were uninterested in cleanliness and hygiene. As evidence that this idea is false, the text cites historian Eleanor Janega's assertion that in medieval Europe, towns usually had at least one bathhouse, where people could take immersion baths or steam baths for a fee. The underlined portion then notes that mainly town dwellers had access to these bathhouses. The remainder of the text explains that those who lacked such access were nonetheless able to bathe in outdoor waterways or take sponge baths at home. Therefore, the underlined portion concedes that some people in medieval Europe lacked access to public bathhouses.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The underlined portion establishes that amenities such as steam baths were mainly available to town dwellers, which suggests in turn that steam baths were largely unavailable to people in rural areas. Thus, the distinction made by the underlined portion is not between the popularity of steam baths in towns versus their lack of popularity in rural areas but instead between their presence in towns and absence in rural areas. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text does explain that recent historians have disproved the idea that medieval Europeans rarely bathed, it doesn't attribute that misconception to earlier historians of medieval Europe or suggest that their research was subject to limitations. Moreover, the underlined portion addresses a limitation of life in medieval Europe, not of historical research. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn't address why historian Eleanor Janega decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe—nor does any portion of the text. The text mentions Janega in passing, but it doesn't go into detail about why she decided to study the popularity of public bathhouses in medieval Europe.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most accurately describes how the underlined portion functions in the text as a whole. The text begins by mentioning scholarly accounts of the Chicano movement, which the underlined portion describes as tending \"to focus on the most militant, outspoken figures in the movement,\" making the movement as a whole seem uniformly radical. The text then indicates that the work of geographer Juan Herrera shows that focusing less on such militant figures and instead paying more attention to manifestations of the Chicano movement in less widely known neighborhood institutions and projects would reveal that the movement's participants embraced a range of political orientations and approaches. Thus, the underlined portion describes a common approach to studying the Chicano movement that, according to the text, obscures the ideological diversity of the movement's participants.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does present a trend in scholarship on the Chicano movement, the text does not indicate that other scholars have reevaluated their methods in light of Herrera's work. It only indicates that Herrera's work suggests that the work of those other scholars does not provide a complete picture of the Chicano movement. Choice B is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does identify an aspect of the Chicano movement that the text indicates has been overemphasized, the text does not discuss the political orientations of the scholars whose work is mentioned in the text. Choice D is incorrect. Though the underlined portion does summarize the conventional method for analyzing the Chicano movement, the rest of the text does not address the effectiveness of \"comparatively low-profile neighborhood institutions and projects.\" Instead, the text suggests that those projects were led by people with a variety of approaches to community activism.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately states the main idea of the text. According to the text, contrary to what some might expect, foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction. The text explains that high reliance on natural-resource extraction can subject a developing country to economic shocks that can destabilize the local currency and introduce economic uncertainty that tends to keep investors away. In other words, although we may think otherwise, foreign investors are less willing to invest in projects in developing countries whose economies are heavily dependent on natural-resource extraction because those economies tend to exhibit instability that investors want to avoid.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The text does indicate that foreign investment is typically lower in developing countries whose economies are more dependent on natural-resource extraction; the text further indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) for which there are fewer investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think. But the text does not implicate the cost of these initial investments as a reason why foreign investment is less widely available than some might think. Choice B is incorrect. The text indicates that greater dependence on natural-resource extraction makes a developing country less appealing to foreign investors because of associated economic instability. Rather than arguing that the goal of developing countries is to become less dependent on foreign investment, as the phrasing of choice B suggests, the text focuses only on why foreign investors become less involved with such countries, which suggests that more investment would be preferable. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that natural-resource extraction requires substantial initial investments (to acquire things like required technologies) and that there are fewer likely investors willing to participate at this stage than one might think, the text does not address what investors are likely to do over time as the industry stabilizes itself.",

Kaštovská and her team observed that microorganism-mediated nutrient cycling was accelerated in the transplanted cores and that \"crucially, microorganism community composition was unchanged,\" which allowed the team to attribute the acceleration to changes in microorganism activity brought about by the difference in temperature. This strongly implies that the team wouldn't have been able to make that attribution otherwise, meaning that a change in microorganism composition represented another possible explanation for the acceleration that had to be ruled out.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text says microorganism-mediated cycling of soil nutrients increased in the transplanted cores, this is unrelated to what's important about the finding that the microorganism composition didn't change—that it allowed the team to attribute the change in activity solely to the change in temperature. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text compares activity in one core at two different elevations, the text doesn't address changes in activity at various elevations over time. Choice D is incorrect. Although different microorganisms likely exhibit different levels of activity, the text indicates that there was no change in microorganism composition, and there is nothing in the text about different microorganisms having different activity levels.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it states a conclusion the researchers likely agree with, given the details in the text. The text explains that a biosignature gas is a gas that can be used as an indicator that a planet harbors some form of life and some astronomers have proposed that NH3 could serve as a biosignature gas. The researchers evaluating this claim found that the atmosphere of rocky planets would be unlikely to reach \"detectably high levels\" of NH3 without biological activity, which would support the proposal of NH3 serving as a biosignature gas. However, the text also states that mini-Neptune planets can produce NH3 in the absence of biological activity. Thus, the text is structured to lead to the conclusion that detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets could constitute a biosignature, but that is not the case for detectable levels of the gas in the atmospheres of mini-Neptune planets.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that biological activity likely accounts for detectable levels of NH3 in the atmospheres of rocky planets but mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres in the absence of biological activity. Therefore, both rocky planets and mini-Neptune planets can have detectable levels of atmospheric NH3. Choice B is incorrect because the text states that for NH3 to reach detectable levels in the atmospheres of rocky planets likely means they harbor biological activity, meaning that rocky planets with detectable NH3 usually harbor biological activity. However, that does not entail that every rocky planet with biological activity will have detectable levels of NH3 in their atmospheres. Choice D is incorrect because the text claims only that some astronomers have proposed using NH3 as a biosignature gas without mentioning a minimum concentration of atmospheric NH3 that must be met for it to function as a biosignature gas.",

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most effectively illustrates the claim that the speaker has contradictory feelings while experiencing the sights and sounds of spring. This quotation indicates that the speaker is reclined in a grove listening to a thousand sounds. Even though the speaker is in a \"sweet mood\" and thinking \"pleasant thoughts,\" those pleasant thoughts also bring to mind \"sad thoughts.\" In other words, these lines illustrate the claim that the speaker is having contradictory thoughts while immersed in the sights and sounds of spring.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although this quotation refers to several flowers (primroses and periwinkles) and indicates that the speaker is in a \"bower,\" or shady spot among the trees—details which suggest that the speaker is experiencing the sights of spring—it doesn't suggest that the speaker is having contradictory feelings, only that the speaker believes that the flowers are experiencing enjoyment. Choice B is incorrect. Although this quotation focuses on the sights of spring—namely, new leaves on nearby trees appear to be opening up (\"The budding twigs spread out their fan\") to feel the breeze—the quotation doesn't suggest that the speaker feels conflicted about this: the statement \"And I must think, do all I can\" suggests the speaker's determination to attribute feelings of pleasure to the trees, not that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Choice C is incorrect. Although this quotation indicates that the speaker isn't certain what the birds are thinking (\"Their thoughts I cannot measure\"), there's nothing to suggest that the speaker is experiencing contradictory feelings. Rather, the quotation suggests that although the speaker is uncertain about the birds' feelings, the speaker believes that the birds' movements likely suggest their pleasure.",

The text describes NFM as an attitude that has lowered people's interest in actively acquiring news and introduces Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl's study on the effects of NFM on people in the United States' political knowledge and interest. The text goes on to say that despite the fact that the study didn't occur near a major election, Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl still conclude that NFA may reduce voting probability. If the likelihood, or probability, that a person will vote is linked to that person's level of political knowledge and interest, that would suggest that negatively affecting a person's level of political knowledge and interest would also negatively affect how likely that person is to vote. Thus, if NFM attitude has a negative effect on political knowledge and interest, then it would also likely reduce voting probability.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the finding that NFM attitude increases as major elections approach wouldn't address the effect of NFM on the likelihood of voting, which is the idea advanced by Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl. Moreover, although the text mentions that there were no major elections that occurred near the time of the study, it doesn't discern between major and minor elections when discussing voting probability. Choice C is incorrect because finding that NFM attitude shows little correlation with either political knowledge or political interest would undermine, not support, Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl's idea that NFM may reduce voting probability because it suggests that NFM has no effect on political knowledge or political interest. Choice D is incorrect. Although Gil de Zúñiga and Diehl's idea would be supported by the finding that the likelihood of voting increases as political knowledge increases, nothing in the text suggests that the researchers' idea hinges on the size of people's social networks.",

The text begins by stating that logging practices are often thought of as being contrary to forest conservation efforts. Then, the text presents the results of a research study examining the effect of limited logging practices on specific forest plots, finding that the plots with limited logging may be \"more robust\" (healthier) than the plots that hadn't been logged at all. Given these results, it follows that logging may be a useful practice for maintaining healthy forests if it is practiced in a limited way.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the study referenced in the text only provides information on limited logging as a potential forest management strategy. There is no information in the text about how other forest management strategies support forest conservation efforts. Therefore, the text does not support the assertion that other forest management strategies are more successful than limited logging. Choice C is incorrect because the text presents a research study with findings that specific plots of forest with limited logging may be more robust than the forest plots that were not logged. Rather than suggesting that it is hard to know whether limited logging might be beneficial, the text suggests that the practice could be useful in forest conservation efforts. Choice D is incorrect. The text discusses the results of a research study that compares the health of forest plots with limited logging to forest plots that were not logged. It does not take a position on the best way to support forest health but rather presents a research study with findings that question conventionally held thoughts regarding the practice of logging.",

After stating that many authors still choose to draft novels by hand even though computers are now widely used, the text acknowledges the speculation that the opposite choice—using only a computer—would have had an effect on such novels. However, the text then points out that every novel is the singular result of a combination of the particular conditions surrounding its creation. This suggests that it isn't possible to determine the effect of any single condition (such as the means of writing) on its own; thus, there would be no way to reasonably evaluate how a novel would have turned out differently if it had been written by other means.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that it's more efficient to write a novel on a computer than to write it by hand; it doesn't address efficiency at all. Therefore, it isn't logical to conclude that authors who currently choose to write novels largely by hand should instead work only on a computer to increase their efficiency. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest anything about how successful authors are, regardless of the means by which they choose to write; therefore, it isn't logical to conclude that authors who write largely by hand are likely to be more successful than those who work only on a computer. Choice C is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the time it takes to produce a novel, regardless of the means by which it's written; therefore, it isn't logical to conclude that novels written by hand take less time on average to produce than those written on a computer do.",

Furthermore, the conjunction \"and\" fails to indicate that what follows is an explanation of goats' nondiscriminatory behavior when it comes to their diets. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. A comma can't be used in this way to join two main clauses (\"goats...indiscriminate\" and \"they... weeds\"). Choice C is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses (\"goats...indiscriminate\" and \"they...weeds\") are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",

It's given that for every increase in the value of \\(x\\) by 1, the value of \\(y\\) increases by 8. The slope of a line can be expressed as the change in \\(y\\) over the change in \\(x\\). Thus, the slope, \\(m\\), of the line representing this relationship can be expressed as \\(\\frac{8}{1}\\), or 8. Substituting 8 for \\(m\\) in the equation \\(y=mx+b\\) yields \\(y=8x+b\\).

Since there are 17 restaurants included in the data set and the numbers of employees are listed in ascending order, it follows that the median number of employees will be represented by the ninth restaurant in the list. Since the first 2 restaurants each have 2 to 7 employees, numbers of employees in the 2 to 7 range would be represented by the first and second restaurants in the list. The next 4 restaurants each have 8 to 13 employees. Therefore, numbers of employees in the 8 to 13 range will be represented by the third through sixth restaurants in the list.

Substituting 0 for \\(x\\) and -6 for \\(y\\) in the given equation yields \\(-6=2(0)^2+b(0)+c\\), or \\(-6=c\\). Therefore, the value of \\(c\\) is -6.

Squaring the binomial on the right-hand side of this equation yields \\(y= 2(x^2+2x+1)-8\\). Multiplying each term inside the parentheses on the right-hand side of this equation by 2 yields \\(y=2x^2+4x+2-8\\), which is equivalent to \\(y=2x^2+4x-6\\). From the given equation \\(y=2x^2+bx+c\\), it follows that the value of \\(b\\) is 4 and the value of \\(c\\) is -6. Therefore, the value of \\(bc\\) is \\((4)(-6)\\), or -24.",

It's given that circle B is the result of shifting circle A down 6 units and increasing the radius so that the radius of circle B is 2 times the radius of circle A. It follows that the center of circle B is 6 units below the center of circle A. The point that's 6 units below (-2, 0) has the same x-coordinate as (-2, 0) and has a y-coordinate that is 6 less than the y-coordinate of (-2, 0). Therefore, the coordinates of the center of circle B are (-2, 0-6), or (-2, -6). Since the radius of circle B is 2 times the radius of circle A, the radius of circle B is (2)(3). A circle in the xy-plane can be defined by an equation of the form \\((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where the coordinates of the center of the circle are \\((h, k)\\) and the radius of the circle is \\(r\\). Substituting -2 for \\(h\\), -6 for \\(k\\), and (2)(3) for \\(r\\) in this equation yields \\((x-(-2))^2+(y-(-6))^2 =((2)(3))^2\\), which is equivalent to \\((x+2)^2+(y+6)^2 =(2)^2(3)^2\\), or \\((x+2)^2 + (y+6)^2 =(4)(9)\\).

Since the sum of the angles in a triangle is equal to 180°, the measure of angle A is equal to 180° - (30+90)°, or 60°. In a right triangle whose acute angles have measures 30° and 60°, the lengths of the legs can be represented by the expressions \\(x\\), \\(x\\sqrt{3}\\), and \\(2x\\), where \\(x\\) is the length of the leg opposite the angle with measure 30°, \\(x\\sqrt{3}\\) is the length of the leg opposite the angle with measure 60°, and \\(2x\\) is the length of the hypotenuse. In the triangle shown, the hypotenuse has a length of 54. It follows that \\(2x = 54\\), or \\(x = 27\\). Therefore, the length of the leg opposite angle B is 27 and the length of the leg opposite angle A is \\(27\\sqrt{3}\\). The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. The length of the leg opposite angle A is \\(27\\sqrt{3}\\) and the length of the leg adjacent to angle A is 27. Therefore, the value of tan A is \\(\\frac{27\\sqrt{3}}{27}\\), or \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\nChoice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. It's given that an exponential model estimates that the number of comments on an article increased by a fixed percentage at the end of each hour. Therefore, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form \\(C= Ka^t\\), where \\(C\\) is the estimated number of comments on the article \\(t\\) hours after the article was first featured on the home page and \\(K\\) and \\(a\\) are constants. It's also given that when the article was first featured on the home page of the news website, there were 40 comments on the article. This means that when \\(t=0\\), \\(C=40\\). Substituting 0 for \\(t\\) and 40 for \\(C\\) in the equation \\(C= Ka^t\\) yields \\(40 = Ka^0\\), or \\(40= K\\). It's also given that the number of comments on the article at the end of an hour had increased by 190% of the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour. Multiplying the percent increase by the number of comments on the article at the end of the previous hour yields the number of estimated additional comments the article has on its home page: \\((40)(\\frac{190}{100})\\), or 76 comments. Thus, the estimated number of comments for the following hour is the sum of the comments from the end of the previous hour and the number of additional comments, which is 40 + 76, or 116. This means that when \\(t= 1\\), \\(C=116\\). Substituting 1 for \\(t\\), 116 for \\(C\\), and 40 for \\(K\\) in the equation \\(C=Ka^t\\) yields \\(116=40a^1\\), or \\(116=40a\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 40 yields \\(2.9 = a\\). Substituting 40 for \\(K\\) and 2.9 for \\(a\\) in the equation \\(C=Ka^t\\) yields \\(C=40(2.9)^t\\). Thus, the equation that best represents this model is \\(C=40(2.9)^t\\).\nChoice A is incorrect. This model represents a situation where the number of comments at the end of each hour increased by 19% of the number of comments at the end of the previous hour, rather than 190%. Choice B is incorrect.

Choice C is incorrect.

It's also given that \\(f\\) is a linear function. It follows that an equation that defines \\(f\\) can be written in the form \\(f(x)=mx+b\\), where \\(m\\) represents the slope and \\(b\\) represents the y-coordinate of the y-intercept (0, b) of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) in the xy-plane. The slope of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) can be found using two points, \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), that are on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\), and the formula \\(m=\\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}\\). Since the table shows values of \\(x\\) and their corresponding values of \\(g(x)\\), substituting values of \\(x\\) and \\(g(x)\\) in the equation \\(g(x)=\\frac{f(x)}{x+3}\\) can be used to define function \\(f\\). Using the first pair of values from the table, \\(x=-27\\) and \\(g(x)=3\\), yields \\(3 = \\frac{f(-27)}{-27+3}\\), or \\(3 = \\frac{f(-27)}{-24}\\). Multiplying each side of this equation by -24 yields \\(-72=f(-27)\\), so the point (–27, –72) is on the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). Using the second pair of values from the table, \\(x=-9\\) and \\(g(x)= 0\\), yields \\(0=\\frac{f(-9)}{-9+3}\\), or \\(0=\\frac{f(-9)}{-6}\\). Multiplying each side of this equation by \\(-6\\) yields \\(0= f(-9)\\), so the point \\((-9, 0)\\) is on the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\). Substituting \\((-27, -72)\\) and \\((-9,0)\\) for \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), respectively, in the formula \\(m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\) yields \\(m = \\frac{0-(-72)}{-9-(-27)}\\), or \\(m = 4\\). Substituting 4 for \\(m\\) in the equation \\(f(x)=mx+b\\) yields \\(f(x)=4x+b\\). Since \\(0=f(-9)\\), substituting \\(-9\\) for \\(x\\) and 0 for \\(f(x)\\) in the equation \\(f(x)=4x+b\\) yields \\(0=4(-9)+b\\), or \\(0=-36+b\\). Adding 36 to both sides of this equation yields \\(36 = b\\). It follows that 36 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept \\((0, b)\\) of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\). Therefore, the y-intercept of the graph of \\(y=f(x)\\) is \\((0, 36)\\).\n\nChoice B is incorrect. 12 is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of \\(y=g(x)\\).

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 54. It's given that in triangle ABC, point D on side AB is connected by a line segment with point E on side AC such that line segment DE is parallel to side BC. It follows that parallel segments DE and BC are intersected by sides AB and AC. If two parallel segments are intersected by a third segment, corresponding angles are congruent. Thus, corresponding angles C and AED are congruent and corresponding angles B and ADE are congruent. Since triangle ADE has two angles that are each congruent to an angle in triangle ABC, triangle ADE is similar to triangle ABC by the angle-angle similarity postulate, where side DE corresponds to side BC, and side AE corresponds to side AC. Since the lengths of corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional, it follows that \\(\\frac{DE}{BC} = \\frac{AE}{AC}\\). Since point E lies on side AC, \\(AE+CE=AC\\).

It's given that there is a linear relationship between the number of cars, c, on a commuter train and the maximum number of passengers and crew, p, that the train can carry. It follows that this relationship can be represented by an equation of the form p=mc+b, where m is the rate of change of p in this relationship and b is a constant. The rate of change of p in this relationship can be calculated by dividing the difference in any two values of p by the difference in the corresponding values of c. Using two pairs of values given in the table, the rate of change of p in this relationship is \\(\\frac{284-174}{5-3}\\), or 55. Substituting 55 for m in the equation p=mc+b yields p=55c+b. The value of b can be found by substituting any value of c and its corresponding value of p for c and p, respectively, in this equation. Substituting 10 for c and 559 for p yields 559=55(10)+b, or 559=550+b. Subtracting 550 from both sides of this equation yields 9 = b. Substituting 9 for b in the equation p=55c+b yields p=55c+9. Subtracting 9 from both sides of this equation yields p-9=55c. Subtracting p from both sides of this equation yields -9=55c-p, or 55c-p=-9.\n\nChoice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that points A and B lie on the circle with center C. Therefore, AC and BC are both radii of the circle. Since all radii of a circle are congruent, AC is congruent to BC. The length of AC, or the distance from point A to point C, can be found using the distance formula, which gives the distance between two points, \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), as \\(\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)^2 + (y_1-y_2)^2}\\). Substituting the given coordinates of point A, \\((h+1, k+ \\sqrt{102})\\), for \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and the given coordinates of point C, \\((h, k)\\), for \\((x_2, y_2)\\) in the distance formula yields \\(\\sqrt{(h+1-h)^2+(k+ \\sqrt{102}-k)^2}\\), or \\(\\sqrt{1^2+ (\\sqrt{102})^2}\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\sqrt{1+102}\\), or \\(\\sqrt{103}\\). Therefore, the length of AC is \\(\\sqrt{103}\\) and the length of BC is \\(\\sqrt{103}\\). It's given that angle ACB is a right angle. Therefore, triangle ACB is a right triangle with legs AC and BC and hypotenuse AB. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length c and legs with lengths a and b, then \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Substituting \\(\\sqrt{103}\\) for a and b in this equation yields \\((\\sqrt{103})^2 + (\\sqrt{103})^2 = c^2\\), or \\(103+103 = c^2\\), which is equivalent to \\(206 = c^2\\). Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields \\(\\sqrt{206} = c\\). Therefore, the length of AB is \\(\\sqrt{206}\\).\n\nChoice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice C is incorrect. This would be the length of AB if the length of AC were 103, not \\(\\sqrt{103}\\). Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is correct. An equation of a line of best fit for data set F can be written in the form y=a+bx, where a is the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the line of best fit and b is the slope. The line of best fit shown for data set E has a y-intercept at approximately (0, 12). It's given that data set F is created by multiplying the y-coordinate of each data point from data set E by 3.9. It follows that a line of best fit for data set F has a y-intercept at approximately (0, 12(3.9)), or (0, 46.8). Therefore, the value of a is approximately 46.8. The slope of a line that passes through points \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) can be calculated as \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\). Since the line of best fit shown for data set E passes approximately through the point (12, 30), it follows that a line of best fit for data set F passes approximately through the point (12, 30(3.9)), or (12, 117). Substituting (0, 46.8) and (12, 117) for \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), respectively, in \\(\\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}\\) yields \\(\\frac{117-46.8}{12-0}\\), which is equivalent to \\(\\frac{70.2}{12}\\), or 5.85. Therefore, the value of b is approximately 5.85, or approximately 5.9. Thus, y=46.8+ 5.9x could be an equation of a line of best fit for data set F.\n\nChoice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice D is incorrect. This could be an equation of a line of best fit for data set E, not data set F.",

      "correct_answer": "-28",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is -28. A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the xy-plane represented by equations in the form Ax + By = C, where A, B, and C are constants, are parallel if the coefficients for x and y in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients for x and y in the other equation. The first equation in the given system, 48x-64y=48y+24, can be written in the form Ax + By = C by subtracting 48y from both sides of the equation to yield 48x-112y= 24. The second equation in the given system, \\(ry=-12x\\), can be written in the form Ax+By= C by adding 12x to both sides of the equation to yield \\(12x+ry=0\\). The coefficient of x in the second equation is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times the coefficient of x in the first equation. That is, \\(48(\\frac{1}{4})=12\\). For the lines to be parallel, the coefficient of y in the second equation must also be \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) times the coefficient of y in the first equation.
