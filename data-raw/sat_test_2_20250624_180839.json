      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Juarez. In this context, \"important\" means marked by significant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of figure in Mexico's history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the \"many significant accomplishments\" from Juarez's long tenure in office. This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico's history.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez's role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was \"unpredictable,\" or tended to behave in ways that couldn't be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly \"secretive\" figure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government's authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an \"ordinary,\" or common and typical, figure in Mexico's history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable figure.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of John Ashbery's poems. As used in this context, \"interpret\" would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery's poems have many unusual features, that it's difficult to tell what exactly the poems' subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it's difficult to interpret Ashbery's poems.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"delegate\" means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery's poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn't suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate. Choice B is incorrect because describing Ashbery's poems as difficult to \"compose,\" or put together or produce, would make sense only if the text were about Ashbery's experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was difficult for Ashbery to compose his poems, but the text doesn't address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems. Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery's poems as being difficult to \"renounce,\" or give up or refuse, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Ashbery's poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate. This context suggests that the poems are difficult to interpret, not that the poems are difficult to renounce.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of the fossil record from the Cambrian period. In this context, \"abrupt\" means sudden. The text explains that the fossil record reflects the unexpected appearance and rapid diversification, or increase in variety, of animal remains during the Cambrian period. This context establishes that these remains' entry into the fossil record was sudden.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the word \"explosion\" appears in the name of the event marked by the fossil record change, the text never suggests that the change was \"catastrophic,\" or disastrous. In context, \"explosion\" refers to the rapid diversification, or the swift increase in variety, of animal remains in the fossil record—a phenomenon that the text presents in a relatively neutral manner, without commenting on whether it was negative or positive. Choice B is incorrect because the text never suggests that the change toward greater diversification is \"elusive,\" or difficult to locate, in the fossil record. Rather, the text notes that the change occurred about 541 million years ago, suggesting that scientists have indeed been able to locate it. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to describe the change in the fossil record as \"imminent,\" or about to occur, since the text indicates that the change already occurred millions of years ago.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the significance of the 2014 archaeological finding at El Algar. In this context, \"concede\" means to admit something is true after first resisting that admission. The text indicates that some researchers believe \"Bronze Age societies were ruled by men.\" But the Bronze Age burial of a woman at El Algar included \"valuable objects signaling a high position of power,\" which would raise the possibility that \"women may have also held leadership roles.\" Thus, the text is calling into question the notion that only men were leaders in these societies and speculating that people holding this view may reconsider their opinion.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because \"waive\" means to refrain from insisting that something, such as a right or a requirement, be observed; the word isn't used, however, in contexts where someone acknowledges that an opinion they hold may be invalid, as is the case in the text. Choice C is incorrect. According to the text, the finding from the El Algar burial site undermines the view that Bronze Age societies were exclusively ruled by men. However, \"refute\" means to demonstrate that something is false and would not make sense in context. Lull and team's finding supports the view that women may have also held leadership roles, not that they did not participate in such roles. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"require\" means to demand or specify as mandatory. However, it would not make sense for contemporary researchers to demand that Bronze Age \"women may have also held leadership roles.\"",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of baleen whale accessory spleens. In this context, \"latent\" means dormant or functionless. The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales' diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is \"replicable,\" or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn't address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn't be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is \"predetermined,\" or decided in advance, wouldn't make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn't been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales. Choice C is incorrect because it's the opposite of what the context of the text is conveying. The second sentence of the text indicates that baleen whale accessory spleens may not be useless, not that they aren't \"operative,\" or functional.",

As used in this context, \"overshadowed by\" means to be surpassed by or caused to seem less important than other factors affecting a move. The text indicates that, according to a US tax policy expert, when people think about an interstate move, state taxes have little effect on their decisions, while employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate have a very strong effect. This context suggests that people consider these other factors to be more important than state taxes.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that state taxes aren't as important a consideration as other factors when people are thinking of moving to another state. The context doesn't suggest that state taxes are \"consistent with,\" or in agreement with these other factors. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that state taxes are \"representative of,\" or typical of, other factors. Taxes aren't an example of employment opportunities, housing availability, and climate, which are the other factors listed in the text. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that state taxes are \"irrelevant to,\" or unconnected or unimportant to other factors. State taxes are irrelevant to peoples' decisions, not to other factors. In other words, although the text suggests that state taxes may be irrelevant to people considering a move to another state, the other factors mentioned in the text, such as employment opportunities, are unable to have an opinion about state taxes. Furthermore, the text indicates that significant differences in state taxes have almost no effect on peoples' choices to move, but they aren't completely unimportant.",

The text states that the women used an axe to strike the maple trees in order to find out which ones would produce sap. The underlined sentence compares the trees to people, with the sap described as the trees' \"life-blood.\" Some of the trees are ready to give out their sap, while others are unwilling to do so. Using personification, the sentence provides greater detail about the aspect of the maple trees—their potential to give sap—that the women are evaluating.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the personalities of the women are not discussed in the text. Although the underlined sentence does mention \"individual characters,\" this reference is not to the women in the text but rather to the maple trees, which the sentence compares to people with individual character traits. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence focuses on the trees' willingness or refusal to yield sap, not on the beneficial relationship between the women and the trees.

      "question_text": "Text 1\nEcologists have long wondered how thousands of microscopic phytoplankton species can live together near ocean surfaces competing for the same resources. According to conventional wisdom, one species should emerge after outcompeting the rest. So why do so many species remain? Ecologists' many efforts to explain this phenomenon still haven't uncovered a satisfactory explanation.\n\nText 2\nEcologist Michael Behrenfeld and colleagues have connected phytoplankton's diversity to their microscopic size. Because these organisms are so tiny, they are spaced relatively far apart from each other in ocean water and, moreover, experience that water as a relatively dense substance. This in turn makes it hard for them to move around and interact with one another. Therefore, says Behrenfeld's team, direct competition among phytoplankton probably happens much less than previously thought.\n\nBased on the texts, how would Behrenfeld and colleagues (Text 2) most likely respond to the “conventional wisdom” discussed in Text 1?",

However, Text 2 explains that according to Behrenfeld and colleagues, phytoplankton are so small and spaced so far apart in the water that there is \"much less\" direct competition for resources within phytoplankton populations than scientists had previously thought.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because Text 2 never discusses whether routine replenishment of ocean nutrients affects competition between phytoplankton species. Choice C is incorrect because the interspecies competition discussed in both texts is specifically between phytoplankton species, and neither text considers whether phytoplankton compete for resources with larger nonphytoplankton species.

The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there's a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don't have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn't leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster's hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn't weaken Foster's hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn't be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn't undermine Foster's hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster's hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn't reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster's hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.",

Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren't social and don't practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn't be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were presented with face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises' responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported.",

The text explains that the Cantares Mexicanos contains poems about the Aztec Empire from before the Spanish invasion. Furthermore, it indicates that notes in the collection attest that some of these poems predate the Spanish invasion, while some customs depicted are likely Spanish in origin. The implication is that some poems were composed before the invasion but the references to Spanish customs could have come about only after the invasion, and thus that the collection includes content that predates the invasion and also content from after the invasion.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that the collection is in Nahuatl, not Spanish, so the compilers' unfamiliarity with Spanish is irrelevant to whether the collection contains material composed after the Spanish invasion. Choice C is incorrect because the text mentions only the Aztec Empire and Spain: there is no information about the relationship of Aztec literature to any traditions other than its own or Spain's. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some of the poems make \"inarguable references\" to common Spanish customs, which conflicts with the idea that these references can reasonably be attributed to mere coincidence.",

The text explains that the study failed to distinguish between outcomes for the tasks performed by the capuchin monkeys, such that simpler tasks requiring less dexterity, or skill, were judged by the same criteria as tasks that demanded more dexterity. Because the study didn't account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text focuses on the fact that the tasks assigned to the capuchin monkeys in the study varied in difficulty and that the variety wasn't taken into consideration. The text doesn't suggest that the capuchin monkeys couldn't perform certain tasks, just that some tasks were more difficult to do. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that the study's results are indicative of the abilities of capuchin monkeys but not of other monkey species; in fact, the text suggests that the results may not even be an accurate reflection of capuchin monkeys' abilities. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the researchers compared results for artificial tasks with those for tasks encountered in the wild, although the tasks described in the text— sliding a panel and putting a straw in a bottle—are presumably artificial.",

The text indicates that the mechanical plastic-recycling process affects the environment and causes \"the loss of material quality.\" The text contrasts that with Chazovachii's chemical plastic-recycling process, which is cleaner and produces a desirable product. The text's emphasis on the negative aspects of mechanical recycling suggests that it is inadequate in terms of environmental impact and the quality of the material the process yields.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"resilient\" would mean able to withstand difficulty and the text does not characterize the plastic-recycling process as having this quality or describe any difficulties that these processes might need to overcome. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"dynamic\" would mean constantly changing. Although the text suggests that there have been changes in the field of recycling, as is the case with the advent of Chazovachii's chemical recycling process, there is nothing to suggest that the mechanical process itself has changed or is prone to change. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"satisfactory\" would mean acceptable but not perfect.

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the economist's claim about sales of personal electronic devices. In this context, \"invalidate\" most nearly means nullify or make invalid. The text indicates that interruptions in the supply of microchips for personal electronics \"have challenged\" the economist's claim that sales of personal electronics will show strong growth in the coming months. The text goes on to clarify the effect of the delays on the economist's projection, stating that the delays are very likely to extend the time frame over which the projected growth in sales will occur. This context suggests that the delays are unlikely to invalidate the economist's projection entirely—the delays will probably alter the time frame of the projection, not nullify it or make it invalid.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to \"dispute,\" or argue against, the economist's projection wouldn't make sense. Since the delays are an inanimate circumstance, they couldn't argue against a prediction about the sales of personal electronics. Choice B is incorrect because saying that the delays are unlikely to \"withdraw,\" or remove from consideration, the economist's projection wouldn't make sense. Although the economist could withdraw her projection because of the delays, the delays themselves couldn't withdraw her projection since they're an inanimate circumstance and thus can't choose to remove something from consideration. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that the delays will \"underscore,\" or emphasize, the economist's projection. Instead, the text suggests that the delays are likely to extend the time frame of the economist's projection but not to undermine the projection entirely.",

The graph shows that the enclosure with lizards and the enclosure without lizards each began with about 85 spiders, and that the number of spiders in each enclosure fell over the 30 days of the study. The student's claim is that the reduction in spiders in the enclosure with lizards is \"entirely attributable to the presence of the lizards,\" meaning that the spider population wouldn't have declined except for the presence of the lizards. This claim is weakened, however, by the fact that the enclosure without lizards also saw a substantial reduction in the number of spiders. Since the number of spiders fell in the enclosure without lizards as well as in the enclosure with lizards, there must be some other factor than just the presence of the lizards that contributed to the reduction in the spider population.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the fact that the two enclosures started with the same number of spiders is irrelevant to the claim that the reduction in spider population by day 30 in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards.

Although it's true that on day 30 the spider population was lower in the enclosure with lizards than in the enclosure without lizards, this fact doesn't weaken the student's claim that the reduction in the spider population in the enclosure with lizards can be entirely attributed to the lizards. Indeed, the lower spider population in the enclosure with lizards suggests that the lizards are contributing to the reduction in the spider population, though the fact that the spider population also fell substantially in the other enclosure means that the lizards aren't the only cause of the reduction.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would most strongly support the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. The text explains that Vaiglova, Liu, and their colleagues analyzed the chemical composition of sheep, goat, and cattle bones from the Bronze Age in China in order to investigate the animals' domestication, or their adaptation from a wild state to a state in which they existed in close connection with humans. According to the text, the team's analysis showed that sheep and goats of the era fed largely on wild plants, whereas cattle fed on millet-importantly, a crop cultivated by humans. If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle's diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team's conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops-and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep's and goats' diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn't support the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sufficient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle's diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements. Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the finding would weaken the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements' crops.",

The text states that Suarez, Pérez-Huerta, and Harrell's research on mosasaur tooth enamel led them to conclude that mosasaurs were endothermic, which means that they could live in waters at many different temperatures and still maintain a stable body temperature. The researchers claim that endothermy enabled mosasaurs to live in relatively cold waters near the poles. If several mosasaur fossils have been found in areas that were near the poles during the period when mosasaurs were alive and fossils of nonendothermic marine reptiles are rare in such locations, that would support the researchers' claim: it would show that mosasaurs inhabited polar waters but nonendothermic marine mammals tended not to, suggesting that endothermy may have been the characteristic that enabled mosasaurs to include polar waters in their range.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because finding that it's easier to determine mosasaur body temperatures from tooth enamel data than it is to determine nonendothermic reptile body temperatures wouldn't support the researchers' claim. Whether one research process is more difficult than another indicates nothing about the results of those processes and therefore is irrelevant to the issue of where mosasaurs lived and what enabled them to live in those locations. Choice B is incorrect because finding roughly equal numbers of mosasaur and nonendothermic marine reptile fossils in areas that were near the poles in the Late Cretaceous would suggest that endothermy didn't give mosasaurs any particular advantage when it came to expanding their range to include relatively cold polar waters, thereby weakening the researchers' claim rather than supporting it. Choice D is incorrect because finding that the temperature of seawater in the Late Cretaceous was warmer than seawater today wouldn't weaken the researchers' claim. Seawater in the Late Cretaceous could have been warmer than seawater today but still cold enough for endothermy to be advantageous to mosasaurs, so this finding wouldn't provide enough information to either support or weaken the researchers' claim.",

The text indicates that although dusky sharks don't usually eat eastern oysters, they do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of eastern oysters. An increase in the abundance of cownose rays in the region in response to a decline in the abundance of dusky sharks would directly support the researchers' hypothesis: a higher number of cownose rays would consume more eastern oysters, driving down the oyster population.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because a finding that there's an association between a decline in the regional abundance of some of dusky sharks' prey and the regional abundance of dusky sharks wouldn't directly support the researchers' hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Although such a finding might help explain why shark abundance has declined, it would reveal nothing about whether the shark decline is related to the oyster decline. Choice B is incorrect because a finding that eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater when dusky sharks and cownose rays are present than when only dusky sharks are present wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren't keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays' predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn't bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Such a finding would suggest that some factor other than shark abundance led to an increase in rays' consumption of oysters and thus to a decrease in oyster abundance, thereby weakening the researchers' hypothesis.",

The text explains that perovskite solar cells' efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor's team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor's team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating.

Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn't support or relate to Taylor and colleagues' conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph. Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues' conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating.",

It's given that the owner pays $4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays \\(4.90s\\) dollars for \\(s\\) small candles and \\(11.60l\\) dollars for \\(l\\) large candles, which means the owner pays a total of \\(4.90s+11.60l\\) dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, \\(4.90s+11.60l \\leq 2,200\\). It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, \\(s+l \\geq 200\\). To combine these inequalities, we can express \\(s\\) in terms of \\(l\\) from the second inequality: \\(s \\geq 200-l\\). Multiplying by 4.90 gives \\(4.90s \\geq 4.90(200−l)\\), which simplifies to \\(4.90s \\geq 980–4.90l\\). Adding \\(11.60l\\) to both sides gives \\(4.90s+11.60l \\geq 980-4.90l +11.60l\\), or \\(4.90s+11.60l \\geq 980+6.70l\\). Combining this with the budget constraint gives the compound inequality \\(980+6.70l \\leq 4.90s+11.60l \\leq 2,200\\). It follows that \\(980+6.70l \\leq 2,200\\). Subtracting 980 from both sides yields \\(6.70l \\leq 1,220\\). Dividing both sides of this inequality by 6.70 yields approximately \\(l \\leq 182.09\\). Since the number of large candles the owner purchases must be a whole number, the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase is the largest whole number less than 182.09, which is 182.",

Since \\(\\angle SOP\\) and \\(\\angle ROQ\\) are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc PS and arc QR are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, \\(\\angle SOR\\) and \\(\\angle POQ\\) are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc SR and arc PQ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let \\(x\\) represent the length of arc SR. Since arc SR and arc PQ are congruent arcs, the length of arc PQ can also be represented by \\(x\\). It's given that the length of arc PS is twice the length of arc PQ. Therefore, the length of arc PS can be represented by the expression \\(2x\\). Since arc PS and arc QR are congruent arcs, the length of arc QR can also be represented by \\(2x\\). This gives the expression \\(x + x + 2x + 2x\\). Since it's given that the circumference is 144π, the expression \\(x+x+2x+2x\\) is equal to 144π. Thus \\(x+x+2x+2x=144π\\), or \\(6x=144π\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields \\(x=24π\\). Therefore, the length of arc QR is \\(2(24π)\\), or 48π.\nChoice A is incorrect. This is the length of arc PQ, not arc QR.

Because it's given that 21 people are in a group and the group consists of adults and children, it must be true that \\(x + y = 21\\). Since the company's revenue is 60 dollars per child, the total revenue from x children in this group was 60x dollars. Since the company's revenue is 80 dollars per adult, the total revenue from y adults in this group was 80y dollars. Because it's given that the total revenue for this group was 1,440 dollars, it must be true that \\(60x +80y = 1,440\\). The equations \\(x+y=21\\) and \\(60x+80y = 1,440\\) form a linear system of equations that can be solved to find the value of x, which represents the number of children in the group, using the elimination method. Multiplying both sides of the equation \\(x+y=21\\) by 80 yields \\(80x+80y = 1,680\\). Subtracting \\(60x+80y=1,440\\) from \\(80x+80y =1,680\\) yields \\((80x+80y)–(60x+80y)=1,680-1,440\\), which is equivalent to \\(80x−60x+80y−80y = 240\\), or \\(20x = 240\\).

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. It's given that right triangle RST is similar to triangle UVW, where S corresponds to V and T corresponds to W. It's given that the side lengths of the right triangle RST are RS=20, ST = 48, and TR =52. Corresponding angles in similar triangles are equal. It follows that the measure of angle T is equal to the measure of angle W. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the longest side. It follows that the hypotenuse of triangle RST is side TR. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite the right angle. Therefore, angle S is a right angle. The adjacent side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side closest to the angle that is not the hypotenuse. It follows that the adjacent side of angle T is side ST. The opposite side of an acute angle in a right triangle is the side across from the acute angle. It follows that the opposite side of angle T is side RS. The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side. Therefore, \\(\\tan T = \\frac{RS}{ST}\\). Substituting 20 for RS and 48 for ST in this equation yields \\(\\tan T = \\frac{20}{48}\\), or \\(\\tan T = \\frac{5}{12}\\). The tangents of two acute angles with equal measures are equal. Since the measure of angle T is equal to the measure of angle W, it follows that \\(\\tan T = \\tan W\\). Substituting \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\) for \\(\\tan T\\) in this equation yields \\(\\frac{5}{12} = \\tan W\\). Therefore, the value of \\(\\tan W\\) is \\(\\frac{5}{12}\\).\nChoice A is incorrect. This is the value of sin W. Choice C is incorrect. This is the value of cos W. Choice D is incorrect. This is the value of \\(\\frac{1}{\\tan W}\\).",

Since the walls of the room will be painted twice, the amount of paint, in gallons, needs to cover 2w square feet. It's also given that one gallon of paint will cover 220 square feet.

It's also given that the number b is 90% less than 47. It follows that \\(b=(1-\\frac{90}{100})(47)\\), or \\(b=0.1(47)\\), which yields \\(b = 4.7\\).

Thus, the equation in choice B could be the second equation in the system.\nChoice A is incorrect. The equation \\(-6x+y=18\\) and the given equation represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have infinitely many solutions, rather than no solution. Choice C is incorrect. The equation \\(-12x+y=36\\) and the given equation represent lines in the xy-plane that are distinct and not parallel. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have exactly one solution, rather than no solution. Choice D is incorrect. The equation \\(-12x+y=18\\) and the given equation represent lines in the xy-plane that are distinct and not parallel. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have exactly one solution, rather than no solution.",

The radius of a circle is the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the circle. If a circle in the xy-plane intersects the y-axis at exactly one point, then the perpendicular distance from the center of the circle to this point on the y-axis must be equal to the length of the circle's radius. It follows that the x-coordinate of the circle's center must be equivalent to the length of the circle's radius. In other words, if the graph of \\((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2\\) is a circle that intersects the y-axis at exactly one point, then \\(r = |h|\\) must be true. The equation in choice C is \\((x-4)^2+(y-9)^2=16\\), or \\((x-4)^2+(y-9)^2 = 4^2\\). This equation is in the form \\((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where h=4, k=9, and r = 4, and represents a circle in the xy-plane with center (4,9) and radius of length 4.
