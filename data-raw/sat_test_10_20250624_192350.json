      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the role of the general store in US rural communities during the 1800s. In this context, \"source\" means a place where something originates or is obtained. The text states that people would share news while socializing at the general store. This context supports the idea that the store served as a source of information in rural communities.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because \"rival\" would mean competitor or opponent. The text doesn't indicate that the general store was a rival of anything. Instead, the text describes the general store as a place that enabled the sharing of information within rural communities. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"condition\" would mean state, circumstance, or requirement. Although the text implies that visiting the store was helpful for acquiring information since people shared news there, it wouldn't make sense to say that the general store was a condition of information. Choice D is incorrect because \"waste\" would mean something that is unused, discarded, or spent unnecessarily, which would not make sense in context. The text describes the general store as an essential part of daily life and a place for socializing and information sharing. The store was therefore a source, not a waste, of information.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Jacob Lawrence's artistic process. In this context, \"observant\" means watchful and perceptive. The text emphasizes that the \"close attention\" Lawrence paid to \"all the details\" of his neighborhood allowed him to reflect subtle elements of \"the beauty and vitality of the Black experience\" in his artwork. This context indicates that being observant of his surroundings was an important part of Lawrence's work as an artist.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was \"skeptical,\" or had an attitude of doubt in general or about particular things, let alone that skepticism was important to him as an artist. Rather than indicating that he was skeptical, the text focuses on how Lawrence paid careful attention to everything around him and reflected his observations in his artwork. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Lawrence was \"critical,\" which in this context would mean inclined to criticize harshly or unfairly. Rather than indicating that Lawrence found fault in things, the text suggests that he paid careful attention to everything around him and that his artwork reflects this careful attention. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that Lawrence was \"confident,\" or self-assured. Rather than addressing how Lawrence felt about himself and how that feeling affected his artistic process, the text emphasizes the careful attention Lawrence paid to everything around him—attention that allowed him to capture subtle elements of a particular place and time in his artwork.",

As used in this context, \"speculates\" would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence. The text states that Ochoa \"doesn't have a definite idea\" about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa's prediction as a \"conjecture,\" or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \"demands,\" or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth's would not make sense in context. The text indicates that she's unsure about the timing but hypothesizes that it will someday happen. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \"doubts,\" or questions or disbelieves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth's would not make sense in context. The text indicates that although Ochoa is unsure about the timing, she hypothesizes that humans will need to live in places other than Earth and encourages research into future travel to the moon. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \"establishes,\" or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth's would not make sense in context.

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, \"synchronization\" means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because referring to \"hibernation,\" or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in—making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in \"prediction,\" or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn't make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to \"moderation,\" or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn't make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn't suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant's flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of historical evidence about ancient Egypt under the reign of the pharaoh Hatshepsut. In this context, \"an exhaustive\" account would be a thorough one. The text states that much of the evidence from her reign was purposely destroyed—in other words, there is a lack of surviving records. This context conveys that unless there are major new archaeological discoveries, an exhaustive account of Hatshepsut's reign is unlikely.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"an imaginative\" account would be an account based on imagination, or ideas and speculation, rather than facts. The text indicates that much of the evidence of Hatshepsut's reign was deliberately destroyed, and a lack of evidence actually makes it more likely that accounts will be imaginative to some degree and not strictly factual. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"a superficial\" account would be one that is lacking in depth or concerned only with what is obvious. The text indicates that most evidence of Hatshepsut's reign was purposely destroyed, which suggests that accounts of that time are likely already somewhat superficial, since there is little information available to support deeper knowledge. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be superficial. Choice D is incorrect because \"a questionable\" account would be one likely to be challenged or doubted, and since the text suggests that little evidence of Hatshepsut's reign has survived, accounts of that time probably involve some speculation and thus may already be open to doubt. Further, it would be illogical to suggest that discovering major new evidence would make it more likely that accounts would be questionable.",

Jazz tap was heavily influenced by jazz music, which became widely popular in the United States in the 1920s. Tap dancers were inspired by jazz music's quick rhythms and by the way jazz musicians would make up melodies as they played. As jazz music continued to develop in the 1930s and 1940s, jazz tap evolved with it.

Therefore, the main purpose of the text is to discuss jazz tap's development.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that jazz music became widely popular in the US in the 1920s and describes some of jazz music's qualities, the text never explains why audiences prefer some kinds of music—jazz or otherwise—over others.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by pointing out an obstacle to observing the astronomical phenomenon of the NCP: the NCP is visible only at night. The text then indicates that, inspired by the ability of some insects and birds to navigate using visualizations of polarized sunlight, researchers devised a way to locate the NCP during daylight. The text then indicates that the researchers mimicked the insects' and birds' polarized-light visualization capabilities using a polarimetric camera. Thus, the text notes an obstacle to observing an astronomical phenomenon, mentions a navigational ability of certain animals that inspired a solution to that obstacle, and then explains how researchers used an optical device to mimic that ability.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although it's reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn't indicate this is the case, let alone that the NCP is relevant to a majority of navigational tools. Furthermore, the text doesn't state that researchers discovered that insects and birds navigate without the NCP; rather, it indicates that it's known that some animals navigate by using skylight polarization to locate the NCP during the day and that this knowledge inspired the method the researchers devised. Choice B is incorrect. Although it's reasonable to conjecture that humans have used the NCP for navigation, the text doesn't state that this is the case. Furthermore, the text discusses how some animals' use of navigational strategies based on the same celestial occurrence served as the inspiration for the researchers' polarized-light approach, not as the basis for a comparison of the relative effectiveness of animal and human methods of navigation. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text implies that humans have typically been able to locate the NCP visually at night and indicates that some animals use the NCP to navigate, the text doesn't state that humans use the NCP for navigation. The text therefore doesn't emphasize a difference between how humans and animals use the NCP for this purpose. Furthermore, the text doesn't suggest that existing navigational instruments will be augmented with polarimetric technologies.",

The first sentence establishes something astronomers believe with some certainty: that Betelgeuse will explode in a supernova. The second sentence then introduces a problem: astronomers aren't certain when Betelgeuse will explode because they don't have enough information about the star's internal characteristics. Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse's internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn't be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn't.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how Nance and colleagues tried to solve it. It is the third sentence that introduces Nance and colleagues, but no serious limitation of their approach to studying a method of determining internal stellar states is described. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It is the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues' conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence doesn't indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn't address this information at all.",

Thus, Gibson combines an object commonly associated with masculinity (a punching bag) with art forms traditionally practiced by women in most Native communities (beadwork and dressmaking).

Although Dorian is depicted as delighted with this particular portrait, there's no way of knowing from the text whether he likes portraits better than other kinds of paintings.

The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s—during most of Morrison's time working there—than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House's published authors, thus supporting the scholar's claim.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the scholar's claim is about Morrison's work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company's list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison's novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn't show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar's claim is about Morrison's work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison's novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House's list of published authors.

Without knowing whether Morrison's stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House.",

If analysis of the animal bones shows that the cattle's diet also consisted of wheat, another crop cultivated by humans in China during the Bronze Age, the finding would support the team's conclusion by offering additional evidence that cattle during this era fed on human-grown crops—and, by extension, that humans raised cattle relatively close to the settlements where they grew these crops, leaving goats and sheep to roam farther away in areas with wild vegetation, uncultivated by humans.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because if it were true that sheep's and goats' diets consisted of small portions of millet, which the text states was a crop cultivated by humans, the finding would suggest that sheep and goats were raised relatively close to human settlements, weakening the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to those settlements than sheep and goats were. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that cattle generally require more food and nutrients than do sheep and goats wouldn't support the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were. Nothing in the text suggests that cattle were incapable of obtaining sufficient food and nutrients without access to human-grown crops. Hence, even if cattle's diets are found to have different requirements than the diets of sheep and goats, the cattle could have met those requirements from food located far from human settlements. Choice D is incorrect because if it were true that the diets of sheep, goats, and cattle varied based on what the farmers in each Bronze Age settlement could grow, the finding would weaken the team's conclusion that cattle were likely raised closer to human settlements than sheep and goats were, suggesting instead that all three types of animals were raised close enough to human settlements to feed on those settlements' crops.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text based on supporting data in the graph. The text indicates that in the fly D. melanogaster, DptA and DptB are genes that encode peptides that both fight pathogens and promote beneficial microbes. Researchers tested D. melanogaster's resistance to P. rettgeri and A. sicerae bacteria based on which variation of the peptide-encoding gene the flies exhibit: DptA silenced (referred to as type A), DptB silenced (type B), or both silenced (type AB). The text also indicates that resistance to P. rettgeri correlates with DptA activity but not with DptB activity (which would manifest as type B flies surviving at a higher rate than other fly types when exposed to P. rettgeri). The graph shows the post-A. sicerae infection results, which indicate that DptB activity was most strongly associated with survival, whereas DptA activity was not (manifesting in the graph as the type A flies having greater survival rates than the other fly types). In other words, when DptA activity was silenced, the flies showed relatively high survival rates, but when DptB activity was silenced, whether on its own or in conjunction with DptA activity being silenced, survival rates were low, suggesting that DptB may have developed as a specific defense against A. sicerae.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The graph suggests that DptA activity is associated with a low rate of survival, not a high one. Furthermore, the graph shows results for flies where DptA alone was silenced, DptB alone was silenced, and both were silenced and thus does not show any flies with activity in both DptA and DptB, which would be necessary to determine whether DptA conferred defense against A. sicerae in the presence of DptB. Choice B is incorrect. Only two bacteria species were considered in the text: P. rettgeri and A. sicerae. The text and graph taken together suggest that activity in DptA is associated with resistance to P. rettgeri while DptB activity is not, and that DptB activity is associated with resistance to A. sicerae while DptA is not. There is no further information to suggest one genetic type confers resistance to a greater number of pathogens than the other. Choice D is incorrect. The graph does not address flies with activity in both DptA and DptB. All flies represented in the graph had one or both of DptA and DptB silenced, or inactive.",

The text establishes that using chemical herbicides to control leafy spurge in North America can also harm other plants nearby. The text then indicates that it might be possible to use engineered DNA to prevent plants from reproducing, which would be useful for \"exclusively targeting\" leafy spurge. If it's possible to exclusively target leafy spurge with engineered DNA—meaning that only leafy spurge is affected by the engineered DNA—and prevent the plant from reproducing, then leafy spurge numbers could be reduced \"without harming other organisms.\"\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text raises the possibility of using engineered DNA to prevent leafy spurge from reproducing, not to make individual leafy spurge plants more vulnerable to chemical herbicides that already exist. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't describe any ecological benefits of leafy spurge in North America; instead, the text is focused on using engineered DNA to prevent leafy spurge from reproducing and thereby reduce its numbers. The only ecological effects of leafy spurge in North America that are described in the text are harmful.

In this context, \"involuntarily\" means done without any control, or by reflex. The text explains that when a person's diaphragm contracts and results in hiccups (which may be important for infants), those muscle contractions are \"uncontrollable.\" This context indicates that the diaphragm contractions occur without the person's control.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers haven't determined exactly why people hiccup, suggesting that it isn't known that the uncontrollable muscle contractions generally occur \"beneficially,\" or with a good or helpful effect—even if one neuroscientist has found that it's possible hiccups play an important positive role for a specific group of people (infants). Choice C is incorrect because the text describes the diaphragm contractions that result in hiccups as \"uncontrollable,\" or happening without the person's control, so it wouldn't make sense to describe them as occurring \"strenuously,\" or in a way that requires great effort or energy. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that the diaphragm contractions resulting in hiccups occur \"smoothly,\" or evenly and continuously. The text doesn't describe the quality of the muscle contractions beyond stating that they are \"uncontrollable.\"",

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the location of the province of Xoconochco within the Aztec Empire. As used in this context, \"peripheral\" means situated toward the outer bounds rather than the center. The text indicates that Xoconochco was located on a coast, hundreds of kilometers away from the capital of the Aztec Empire. The text also states that trade between the province and the capital required \"a long overland journey.\" This context suggests that Xoconochco was situated toward an edge of the empire's territory rather than near its center.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to refer to Xoconochco's location within the Aztec Empire as \"unobtrusive,\" or not blatant or undesirably prominent; it's not clear how a province's physical location would or wouldn't be blatant. Instead of focusing on how noticeable Xoconochco's location was, the text emphasizes the province's distance from the capital of the empire, pointing out that because of this distance trade between the two required \"a long overland journey.\" Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the province of Xoconochco was located on a coast far from the capital of the Aztec Empire, not that it was \"concealed,\" or kept out of sight or hidden from view. Nothing in the text suggests that Xoconochco was actually hidden such that people couldn't see it, and being hidden wouldn't necessarily result in trade between the province and the capital requiring \"a long overland journey.\" Choice C is incorrect because to say that Xoconochco's location within the Aztec Empire was \"approximate\" would mean that the location either wasn't precisely correct or was close to some other location. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text indicates that Xoconochco's location is known and that it was far from the empire's capital, so there's no reason to characterize the location as either not precisely correct or close to another location.",

The text indicates that raising the age for these funds is usually discussed in terms of effects on fund recipients but that Andria Smythe is instead considering the effects on working family members who care for retirees. Smythe notes that raising the age for the funds would increase the length of time retirees are dependent on financial assistance from working family members. This is suggested to have an effect on wealth creation for those workers, and most logically, that effect would be disadvantageous. Thus, \"stymie,\" which means to prevent or greatly hinder, is the most logical choice in context.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because in this context, \"compound\" would most nearly mean multiply or greatly enhance. The text indicates that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds will increase the amount of time retirees are dependent on working family members for financial support. This would likely have a negative rather than a positive effect on wealth creation. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"disparage\" would most nearly mean criticize or defame. Nothing in the text suggests that raising the age at which retirees are eligible for government funds would defame wealth creation among working adults. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"outstrip\" would most nearly mean to exceed, and nothing in the text indicates that the financial support provided to retirees would exceed the amount of wealth these workers can create. The text does suggest that workers providing funds to retirees works against those workers' wealth accumulation, but not that the support to retirees exceeds the workers' accumulated wealth.",

The text begins by noting the rise of political blogs with readily identifiable ideological alignments in the early 2000s. The text then indicates that some commentators saw this as a positive development, citing a reason why (their difference from traditional news). Finally, the text goes on to contrast those commentators with others who have a negative opinion of the rise of political blogs (because they increase political polarization among their readers). This context supports the idea that the second group of commentators is less positive than the first: thus, the second group of commentators is less optimistic, or sanguine.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it would not make sense in this context to describe those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs as less \"recalcitrant,\" or obstinately uncooperative, than those commentators who supported political blogs. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs are less \"misanthropic,\" or less contemptuous of humankind, than those commentators who have a positive opinion of political blogs—there is no indication in the text that those commentators who like political blogs would be contemptuous of humankind at all. Choice D is incorrect because there is no evidence that those commentators who have a negative opinion of political blogs are less \"earnest,\" or sincere, than those who have a positive opinion of such blogs—presumably, both groups of commentators hold their beliefs with equal conviction.",

Although the underlined portion characterizes the waves as a relentless force (always \"repulsed\" but still \"rushing on\" and never being defeated), the speaker doesn't suggest that the surroundings are intimidating.

The Lord Chancellor's response is to ask what their shouting means but also to observe that they're shouting with \"unanimity,\" or total agreement. Clearly, this isn't the case, which supports the statement that the Lord Chancellor describes the crowd as being united even though it's not.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it isn't supported by the text.

Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that the Lord Chancellor wants to speak to the crowd. Furthermore, the text doesn't indicate that the crowd wants to hear from the Sub-Warden. Although the crowd roars when asked \"Who roar for the Sub-Warden?\" it's unclear what the roaring means.

One limitation of the cells, however, has to do with their electron transport layer (ETL), through which absorbed electrons must pass. Often the ETL is applied through a process called spin coating, but such ETLs are fairly inefficient at converting input power to output power. André Taylor and colleagues tested a novel spray coating method for applying the ETL. The team produced ETLs of various thicknesses and concluded that spray coating holds promise for improving the power conversion efficiency of ETLs in perovskite solar cells.\n\nWhich choice best describes data from the graph that support Taylor and colleagues' conclusion?",

The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seafloor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seafloor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seafloor shells, which contradicts the text's description of shells from the seafloor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach. Choice D is incorrect because knowing which depth has the most artifacts or whether the clam population fluctuated does not help explain why tools made from the less desirable shells from the beach outnumber tools made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor.",

The text explains that perovskite solar cells' efficiency at converting light into electricity is diminished by their electron transport layer (ETL), which is applied through spin coating, but that Taylor's team devised a new spray coating method for applying the ETL that improves its power conversion efficiency. The graph displays data on the power conversion efficiency of solar cells in tests conducted by Taylor's team, with bars for both the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs in two data categories: spray coating and spin coating. According to the graph, the lowest-performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency of between 14% and 16%, while the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating had a power conversion efficiency of less than 14%. These data confirm that ETLs applied through novel spray coating are more efficient than those applied though traditional spin coating. Thus, the data support Taylor and colleagues' conclusion about spray coating's potential value.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although this claim correctly describes the data in the graph by stating that both the lowest-performing ETL applied through spin coating and the lowest- performing ETL applied through spray coating had a power conversion efficiency greater than 10%, this relationship in the data doesn't support or relate to Taylor and colleagues' conclusion that spray coating promises greater efficiency for solar cells than traditional spin coating does. Choice C is incorrect. This claim does address the greater power conversion efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating, compared with the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating. However, it also incorrectly cites the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spray coating as approximately 13%, instead of a value between 14% and 16%, and the value for the efficiency of the highest-performing ETL applied through spin coating as approximately 11%, instead of a value between 12% and 14%, as shown in the graph. Choice D is incorrect because Taylor and colleagues' conclusion is based on the difference in the power conversion efficiency of ETLs applied through spray coating and that of ETLs applied through spin coating, not on the difference between the highest- and lowest-performing ETLs applied through just spray coating.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically follows from the text's discussion of the study of capuchin monkeys' cognitive abilities. The text explains that the study failed to distinguish between outcomes for the tasks performed by the capuchin monkeys, such that simpler tasks requiring less dexterity, or skill, were judged by the same criteria as tasks that demanded more dexterity. Because the study didn't account for this discrepancy, the researchers might have assumed that observed differences in performance were due to the abilities of the monkeys rather than the complexity of the tasks. In other words, the results may suggest cognitive differences among the monkeys even though such differences may not really exist.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text focuses on the fact that the tasks assigned to the capuchin monkeys in the study varied in difficulty and that the variety wasn't taken into consideration. The text doesn't suggest that the capuchin monkeys couldn't perform certain tasks, just that some tasks were more difficult to do. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that the study's results are indicative of the abilities of capuchin monkeys but not of other monkey species; in fact, the text suggests that the results may not even be an accurate reflection of capuchin monkeys' abilities. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the researchers compared results for artificial tasks with those for tasks encountered in the wild, although the tasks described in the text—sliding a panel and putting a straw in a bottle—are presumably artificial.",

Since angles B and E each have the same measure and angles C and F each have the same measure, triangles ABC and DEF are similar, where side BC corresponds to side EF. To determine whether two similar triangles are congruent, it is sufficient to determine whether one pair of corresponding sides are congruent. Therefore, to determine whether triangles ABC and DEF are congruent, it is sufficient to determine whether sides BC and EF have equal length. Thus, the lengths of BC and EF are sufficient to determine whether triangle ABC is congruent to triangle DEF. Choice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual errors. Choice D is incorrect. The given information is sufficient to determine that triangles ABC and DEF are similar, but not whether they are congruent.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is correct. It's given that the window repair specialist charges $220 for the first two hours of repair plus an hourly fee for each additional hour. Let n represent the hourly fee for each additional hour after the first two hours. Since it's given that x is the number of hours of repair, it follows that the charge generated by the hourly fee after the first two hours can be represented by the expression \\(n(x - 2)\\). Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is \\(f(x)=220+n(x-2)\\). It's given that the total cost for 5 hours of repair is $400. Substituting 5 for x and 400 for f(x) into the equation \\(f(x)=220+n(x-2)\\) yields \\(400 = 220+n(5-2)\\), or \\(400=220+ 3n\\). Subtracting 220 from both sides of this equation yields \\(180 = 3n\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 3 yields \\(n = 60\\). Substituting 60 for n in the equation \\(f(x)=220+n(x-2)\\) yields \\(f(x)=220+60(x - 2)\\), which is equivalent to \\(f(x)=220+60x-120\\), or \\(f(x)=60x+100\\). Therefore, the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair is \\(f(x)=60x+100\\). Choice B is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges $340, rather than $220, for the first two hours of repair. Choice C is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges $160, rather than $220, for the first two hours of repair, and an hourly fee of $80, rather than $60, after the first two hours. Choice D is incorrect. This function represents the total cost, in dollars, for x hours of repair where the specialist charges $380, rather than $220, for the first two hours of repair, and an hourly fee of $80, rather than $60, after the first two hours.",

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 29/3. Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of the given equation, \\(x(x+1)-56\\), yields \\(x^2+x-56\\). Applying the distributive property to the right-hand side of the given equation, \\(4x(x - 7)\\), yields \\(4x^2 - 28x\\). Thus, the equation becomes \\(x^2+x-56=4x^2 - 28x\\). Combining like terms on the left- and right-hand sides of this equation yields \\(0=(4x^2-x^2)+(-28x-x)+56\\), or \\(3x^2-29x+56=0\\). For a quadratic equation in the form \\(ax^2+bx+c=0\\), where a, b, and c are constants, the quadratic formula gives the solutions to the equation in the form \\(x=\\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\). Substituting 3 for a, -29 for b, and 56 for c from the equation \\(3x^2-29x+56=0\\) into the quadratic formula yields \\(x = \\frac{-(-29) \\pm \\sqrt{(-29)^2-4(3)(56)}}{2(3)}\\), or \\(x=\\frac{29 \\pm 13}{6}\\).

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 5. The standard form of an equation of a circle in the xy-plane is \\((x-h)²+(y-k)²= r²\\), where h, k, and r are constants, the coordinates of the center of the circle are (h, k), and the length of the radius of the circle is r. It's given that an equation of the circle is \\((x-2)²+(y-9)²=r²\\). Therefore, the center of this circle is (2, 9). It's given that the endpoints of a diameter of the circle are (2, 4) and (2, 14). The length of the radius is the distance from the center of the circle to an endpoint of a diameter of the circle, which can be found using the distance formula, \\(\\sqrt{(x_1-x_2)² + (y_1-y_2)²}\\). Substituting the center of the circle (2, 9) and one endpoint of the diameter (2, 4) in this formula gives a distance of \\(\\sqrt{(2-2)² + (9-4)²}\\), or \\(\\sqrt{0² +5²}\\), which is equivalent to 5. Since the distance from the center of the circle to an endpoint of a diameter is 5, the value of r is 5.",

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Since each choice has a term of \\(3x²\\), which can be written as (3x)(x), and each choice has a term of 14b, which can be written as (7)(2b), the expression that has a factor of x + 2b, where b is a positive integer constant, can be represented as (3x+7)(x + 2b). Using the distributive property of multiplication, this expression is equivalent to \\(3x(x+2b) +7(x+2b)\\), or \\(3x²+6xb+7x+14b\\). Combining the x-terms in this expression yields \\(3x²+(7+6b)x+14b\\). It follows that the coefficient of the x-term is equal to 7+6b. Thus, from the given choices, 7+6b must be equal to 7, 28, 42, or 49. Therefore, 6b must be equal to 0, 21, 35, or 42, respectively, and b must be equal to \\(\\frac{0}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{21}{6}\\), \\(\\frac{35}{6}\\), or \\(\\frac{42}{6}\\), respectively.

It follows that 7 + 6b must be equal to 49 because this is the only choice for which the value of b is a positive integer constant. Therefore, the expression that has a factor of x+2b is \\(3x²+49x+14b\\).\n\nChoice A is incorrect. If this expression has a factor of x + 2b, then the value of b is 0, which isn't positive.
