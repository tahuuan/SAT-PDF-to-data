      "question_text": "The following text is adapted from Ida B. Wells's 1970 autobiography A Crusade for Justice. Mr. Watts is a reference to George Frederic Watts, an English painter. [Manchester's] art galleries are so arranged that the name of every picture is plainly seen and one has no need of a catalogue to pick out the name and the artist. This is a convenience to the general public, which other art galleries, which shall be nameless, might copy to advantage. To her treasure of art Manchester has added Mr. Watts' latest picture, the Good Samaritan. ©1970 by the University of Chicago Press As used in the text, what does the word “arranged\" most nearly mean?",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because as used in the text, \"arranged\" most nearly means \"organized.\" The text states that a welcome feature of Manchester's art galleries (as opposed to others) is that the titles of the paintings are easy to see and that a catalogue is therefore unneeded while visitors browse the art galleries. This suggests that the paintings are displayed in a systematic, or organized, way. Choice B is incorrect. \"Ranked\" might mean either classified or placed in orderly rows. Neither of these meanings would necessarily imply that the names of the paintings are easy to see (even if the paintings are placed in rows, their labels might be obscured). Choice C is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to describe the paintings as \"scheduled,\" or planned to take place at a certain time. Choice D is incorrect because if the paintings were \"discussed,\" or talked about, this would have no bearing on whether the names of the paintings could be easily seen.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the challenge of generating electricity from ocean waves. In this context, \"consistent\" means steady or unchanging over time. The text introduces a challenge and then explains that wave power varies, or changes, unpredictably in ways that cause problems for electricity generation. This context conveys that the challenge being described is a lack of consistency. Choice A is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn't indicate that wave power isn't \"accidental,\" or isn't happening unintentionally. It wouldn't make sense to describe waves-a natural occurrence-as happening intentionally. Choice B is incorrect because \"confident\" means having a feeling of self-assurance, and it wouldn't make sense to describe wave power itself in terms of either having or lacking a sense of confidence. Choice C is incorrect because the text introduces a challenge and then elaborates on it by emphasizing that the unpredictable nature of variations in ocean waves causes problems, which doesn't indicate that wave power isn't \"expensive,\" or isn't costly. If anything, technological and planning problems might actually increase the expense of generating electricity from waves.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of John Ashbery's poems. As used in this context, \"interpret\" would mean decipher the meaning of. The text indicates that Ashbery's poems have many unusual features, that it's difficult to tell what exactly the poems' subject matter is, and that scholars strongly disagree about the poems. This context conveys the idea that it's difficult to interpret Ashbery's poems. Choice A is incorrect because \"delegate\" means to assign someone as a representative of another person or to entrust something to someone else, neither of which would make sense in context. The text is focused only on the difficulty that readers have interpreting Ashbery's poems due to their many unusual features; it doesn't suggest anything about the poems being difficult to delegate. Choice B is incorrect because describing Ashbery's poems as difficult to \"compose,\" or put together or produce, would make sense only if the text were about Ashbery's experience of writing the poems. It could be true that it was difficult for Ashbery to compose his poems, but the text doesn't address this; it instead discusses how readers interpret and engage with the poems. Choice D is incorrect because describing Ashbery's poems as being difficult to \"renounce,\" or give up or refuse, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on the idea that features of Ashbery's poems are odd or unclear and have caused heated scholarly debate. This context suggests that the poems are difficult to interpret, not that the poems are difficult to renounce.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of the artist Diego Velázquez's influence outside Spain. As used in this context, \"confined to\" means restricted to. The text says that Velázquez was the leading artist in the Spanish court during the seventeenth century, but it also notes that other painters around the world were influenced by his techniques and style. Thus, Velázquez's influence was hardly (or almost not) confined to, or restricted to, Spain. Choice A is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in Spain, it doesn't make logical sense to claim that his influence was hardly (or almost not) derived from, or obtained from, Spain. Moreover, the other painters around the world who employed Velázquez's techniques would by definition be influenced by Spanish style. Choice B is incorrect because if Velázquez was a leading artist in the court of King Philip IV of Spain, then his influence must have been widely recognized, or acknowledged, rather than being hardly (or almost not) recognized. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that deliberately limiting Velázquez's influence outside Spain was ever considered by anyone. Thus, even if it is true that his influence was not repressed, or restrained, it doesn't make logical sense to say so in this context.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the discussion of Octavia Butler's career. In this context, \"impenetrable\" means impossible to enter. The text indicates that the field of science fiction was dominated by white males when Butler, a Black woman, started writing, but she published several science fiction short stories and a novel and later won a prestigious award; that is, Butler pursued science fiction writing and had success. This context suggests that Butler didn't view the genre as impossible to enter. Choice A is incorrect. In this context, \"legitimate\" would mean genuinely good or valid. Nothing in the text suggests that Butler didn't think the science fiction genre was good or valid; in fact, it indicates that she pursued and made a successful career of publishing work in that field. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"compelling\" would mean attracting or demanding attention. The text indicates that Butler chose to write science fiction, so it wouldn't make sense to say that she didn't see the field as drawing her attention. Choice D is incorrect. To say that Butler didn't consider science fiction \"indecipherable,\" or impossible to understand, would suggest that Butler did understand it. However, the text doesn't address Butler's ability to interpret works in the genre; rather, it focuses on Butler's successful pursuit of writing science fiction.",

Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate what kinds of topics Uncle Katsuhisa enjoys discussing, only that he is loud even when he isn't speaking. Choice B is incorrect because the text never indicates how Uncle Katsuhisa feels about meeting new people, only how loud he is.

The underlined sentence offers information about how Yamauchi ultimately succeeded in adapting the story into a play: it explains that Yamauchi created situations where the characters of the play could reveal their internal thoughts while speaking with each other. Choice B is incorrect because neither the underlined sentence nor the text as a whole makes any mention of playwrights other than Yamauchi or how the play might have influenced them. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that Yamauchi is best known for her play And the Soul Shall Dance, which conveys that the play is better known than the short story it's based on is.

The text establishes that many countries have adopted risk-disclosure requirements for financial products due to concerns that consumers don't understand the risks associated with the products. According to the text, Seira et al. found that the effects of such messaging on consumer behavior were small and temporary. The text then adds that the researchers assert that because the cost of the messaging is negligible, the approach may be worth doing even if the effects are limited. Thus, the underlined portion notes a factor-very low cost-that led the researchers to not completely dismiss risk-disclosure messaging despite their evidence of its limited utility. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn't refer to a particular type of risk-disclosure messaging, whether Seira et al. considered it or not; the underlined portion simply indicates that the cost of the messaging (broadly) is very low, which makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited. Choice C is incorrect. Although the underlined portion does describe a consideration that led the researchers to recommend risk-disclosure messaging despite the messaging's small effects on consumer behavior, it directly states that the cost of such messaging is negligible, or very low-meaning that both the effects and the costs are small, not that the effects are small only relative to the costs. Choice D is incorrect because there's no indication that Seira et al. suggest that risk-disclosure messaging could be more effective if it had lower costs; rather, the underlined portion indicates that Seira et al. believe the already negligible cost of messaging makes the approach worth pursuing even if its effects are limited.",

Economist Ying Fan investigated this notion in the context of the United States newspaper market. She modeled a hypothetical merger of Minneapolis-area newspapers and found that subscription prices would rise following a merger. Text 2 Economists Dario Focarelli and Fabio Panetta have argued that research on the effect of mergers on prices has focused excessively on short-term effects, which tend to be adverse for consumers. Using the case of consumer banking in Italy, they show that over the long term (several years, in their study), the efficiency gains realized by merged companies do result in economic benefits for consumers.

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because, based on the information presented in the texts, it represents how Focarelli and Panetta would most likely respond to Fan's findings. Text 1 indicates that Fan found that a newspaper merger would result in a rise in subscription prices. This rise wouldn't benefit customers, who would have to pay more for news after a merger. Text 2 presents Focarelli and Panetta's argument that merger research tends to focus too much on what happens immediately after the merger. Text 2 goes on to describe their finding that mergers can be economically beneficial for consumers over the long term. This suggests that Focarelli and Panetta would encourage Fan to investigate the long-term effect of the hypothetical newspaper merger on subscription prices. Choice A is incorrect because Text 2 doesn't indicate that Focarelli and Panetta connect the effects of mergers to specific locations. Instead, Focarelli and Panetta focus on the length of time over which the effects of mergers should be evaluated. Choice B is incorrect because Text 2 indicates that Focarelli and Panetta found that merged companies experience \"efficiency gains\" over the long term, meaning that their expenses go down relative to their output, not that their expenses increase. Choice D is incorrect because there's no indication in Text 2 that Focarelli and Panetta believe that the newspaper industry is different from any other industry when it comes to the effects of mergers. Although their own research was about consumer banking, Text 2 suggests that they view their conclusions as applicable to mergers in general.",

Rather than indicating that Pando isn't producing young trees anymore, the text reveals that Pando is indeed producing young trees, stating that those trees can be protected from grazing deer by strong fences. Choice C is incorrect because the text states that fences can be used to prevent deer from eating Pando's young trees, not that Pando itself can't grow in new areas because it's blocked by fences.

The graph compares the metal content of two groups of plants, one with kanamycin exposure and a control group without such exposure. The amount of zinc in plants without kanamycin exposure is around 400 parts per million, while the amount of zinc in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at around 300 parts per million. Similarly, the amount of iron in plants without kanamycin exposure is a little over 600 parts per million, while the amount of iron in plants with kanamycin exposure is lower, at a little over 200 parts per million. Thus, the graph shows that plants with kanamycin exposure have significantly lower levels of both iron and zinc than the plants without kanamycin exposure. This is evidence supporting the hypothesis that kanamycin exposure results in plants altering their uptake of metals. Choice A is incorrect because the graph shows that control plants contained higher levels of iron than zinc, not higher levels of zinc than iron; similarly, the plants exposed to kanamycin contained higher levels of zinc than iron, not higher levels of iron than zinc. Choice B is incorrect. Though the claim that both groups of plants contained more than 200 parts per million of both iron and zinc is supported by the graph, this alone does not state whether plants with kanamycin exposure have a different metal content than plants without kanamycin exposure.

According to the text, the researcher hypothesized that Arctic ground squirrels would exhibit longer torpor bouts and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots do-or, put the other way, that the marmots would show shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the ground squirrels do. The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher's hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did. Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn't support the researcher's hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn't sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn't support the researcher's hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn't address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals' torpor bouts compared. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't support the researcher's hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn't sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the graph to complete the student's conclusion about beehive structure. The text explains that in the hives of honeybees, the hexagonal cells housing drone eggs are larger than the hexagonal cells housing worker eggs, and that this size difference results in a construction problem that the bees address by using nonhexagonal cells to fill gaps between sections of drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells. The text also states that the size difference between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells varies by species of honeybee. The graph displays data on the percentage of nonhexagonal cells in the hives of three species. In the hives of the western honeybee, the percentages of five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells are all less than 0.5%. But in the hives of the black dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are higher than those for the western honeybee: about 2.5% for both. And for the dwarf honeybee, the percentages of five-sided and seven-sided cells are also higher than those for the western honeybee: slightly over 2.5% and slightly over 2.0%, respectively; additionally, the dwarf honeybee possesses a higher percentage of eight-sided cells than the western honeybee does. Taken altogether, the graph shows that the hives of the western honeybee consist of a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells than the hives of the two other species do. Since the nonhexagonal cells exist only to solve the construction problem arising from the difference in size between drone-egg cells and worker-egg cells, a smaller percentage of nonhexagonal cells would be associated with a smaller size difference between the two types of cells. Therefore, it can be concluded from the data that worker-egg cells are probably closer in size to drone-egg cells in the hives of the western honeybee than in the hives of the other two species. Choice B is incorrect because, as the text states, honeybee species deposit their eggs in hexagonal cells, not in nonhexagonal ones. Thus, the western honeybee and black dwarf honeybee wouldn't deposit drone eggs in eight-sided cells, and the dwarf honeybee wouldn't deposit drone eggs in seven-sided cells. Choice C is incorrect. The text explains that honeybees rely mainly on one geometric shape, the hexagon, when constructing their hives, and the graph shows that the western honeybee relies on the same nonhexagonal shapes as the dwarf honeybee does: five-sided, seven-sided, and eight-sided cells. In other words, the western honeybee and dwarf honeybee rely on the same number of geometric shapes. For the black dwarf honeybee, the graph displays data only for five-sided and seven-sided cells, which suggests a total absence of eight-sided cells. Yet this would be only one less nonhexagonal shape than is seen in the western honeybee. Thus, based on the graph, it would be inaccurate to say that the western honeybee relies on \"many more\" geometrical shapes than the other two species do. Choice D is incorrect. As the text explains, honeybee hives consist mainly of hexagonal cells, and sections of nonhexagonal cells are used to connect sections of hexagonal cells of different sizes. Since the graph indicates that the percentage of nonhexagonal cells is lower for the western honeybee than it is for the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee, the western honeybee would conversely have a higher percentage of hexagonal cells than the either the dwarf honeybee or black dwarf honeybee does, not a lower percentage.",

The text explains that borrowers in the ALSOL program use proceeds from their businesses to repay loans in equal weekly payments, with almost no penalty for missed payments. According to the text, Barboza and Trejos found that rural borrowers miss weekly payments in part because they don't sell their goods as often as they could, a move the researchers claim allows the entrepreneurs to help increase profits for the goods they sell. Finding that the cost of bringing goods to towns with marketplaces is high for rural entrepreneurs but is largely independent of how many goods are brought would support the researchers' claim: traveling to marketplaces less frequently would mean that a rural entrepreneur spends less on travel overall, and taking a large load of goods to a marketplace for essentially the same cost as taking a small load would allow the entrepreneur to more substantially offset the cost of travel with greater overall sales at the marketplace, resulting in more profit per good sold-even if those profits are earned less frequently and don't support weekly loan payments. Choice A is incorrect because the finding that many marketplaces require entrepreneurs to pay the operators of the marketplace a fixed percentage of proceeds to be able to sell goods there wouldn't explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. With a fixed percentage of proceeds due to operators, the amount entrepreneurs have to pay operators would also be fixed regardless of frequency of selling. Choice B is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs can usually sell their goods for higher prices in cities than in their local areas but also face higher competition to sell goods in cities wouldn't explain why rural entrepreneurs strategically choose to sell their goods less frequently than they could in order to increase their profits per unit sold. This is because both the higher prices and higher competition in cities would be stable factors-meaning there would be no clear reason for the rural entrepreneurs not to take every available chance to sell their goods in cities and to instead sell their goods in cities only sometimes. Choice C is incorrect because the finding that rural entrepreneurs have lower costs and thus tend to require smaller initial loans than urban entrepreneurs do has no bearing on rural borrowers strategically choosing to sell their goods less frequently than they could specifically to increase their profits per unit sold. The cost of producing goods doesn't depend on the frequency with which an entrepreneur sells those goods, so lower frequency alone wouldn't affect profits, and the initial loan amount is set and has nothing to do with how much profit is earned from each sale.",

      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Anita Allen's argument about judges citing philosophers in their judicial opinions. The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial opinions and that, according to Allen, judges tend to cite philosophers whose views are in agreement with those of the judges themselves. Allen claims, however, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and rebut them, which suggests that judges may be able to strengthen their opinions by including discussions of philosophers with views contrary to their own. Choice A is incorrect because Allen's claim is that judges could improve their judicial opinions by citing philosophers who disagree with the views expressed in the opinions, which would necessarily require judges to consult philosophical works. Choice C is incorrect because there's no discussion in the text about making judicial opinions more easily understood by any particular group of readers. The focus of the text is on Allen's claim that judicial opinions could be strengthened by the inclusion of discussions of philosophers whose views disagree with those of the judges authoring the opinions. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents Allen's argument that discussing philosophers whose views judges disagree with could strengthen judicial opinions, not that doing so could bring those opinions into line with views that are popular among philosophers.",

The text says that Dingle \"skillfully winds\" parts of palmetto palm plants around sweetgrass plants to make baskets with an appearance that \"no factory can reproduce.\" This context suggests that Dingle's baskets are handmade from sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice A is incorrect because the text describes how Dingle uses sweetgrass and palmetto palm to create her baskets, not how her baskets are \"indicated by,\" or signified by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm. Choice C is incorrect. Although Dingle's baskets are described as being made using sweetgrass and palm, there's nothing in the text to suggest that the baskets are \"represented by,\" or exemplified or portrayed by, sweetgrass and palmetto palm.

Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka's effort related to public health as \"impartial,\" or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn't make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka's continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specifically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka's effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn't make sense to describe it as \"offhand,\" or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka's effort to promote public health was \"mandatory,\" or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator.

It's the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict.

The text describes the book Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl as Smart-Grosvenor's \"most influential project\" and as \"unusual for its time.\" The text also notes that the book and author have influenced contemporary approaches to writing about food and cooking. Therefore, the text mainly conveys that Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl is an unconventional and important contribution to food writing. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text mentions that Smart-Grosvenor worked in national public television and radio and was a food writer, these details aren't the main focus. Rather than focusing on Smart-Grosvenor's various jobs, the text focuses specifically on one specific book she wrote. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text suggests that Vibration Cooking: or, the Travel Notes of a Geechee Girl was groundbreaking, it doesn't suggest that the book didn't receive praise when it was published. In fact, the text states that the book is \"long admired.\" Choice D is incorrect because the text states that Smart-Grosvenor was a culinary anthropologist and that her book influenced later approaches to food writing but doesn't indicate that Smart-Grosvenor or her book influenced people to begin cooking for themselves.",

Near Vancouver Island in Canada, the otter population is large and well established, yet the eelgrass meadows are healthier than those found elsewhere off Canada's coast. To explain this, conservation scientist Erin Foster and colleagues compared the Vancouver Island meadows to meadows where otters are absent or were reintroduced only recently. Finding that the Vancouver Island meadows have a more diverse gene pool than the others do, Foster hypothesized that damage to eelgrass roots increases the plant's rate of sexual reproduction; this, in turn, boosts genetic diversity, which benefits the meadows' health overall. Which finding, if true, would most directly undermine Foster's hypothesis?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would weaken Foster's hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots improves the health of eelgrass meadows by boosting genetic diversity. The text indicates that sea otters damage eelgrass roots but that eelgrass meadows near Vancouver Island, where there's a large otter population, are comparatively healthy. When Foster and her colleagues compared the Vancouver Island eelgrass meadows to those that don't have established otter populations, the researchers found that the Vancouver Island meadows are more genetically diverse than the other meadows are. This finding led Foster to hypothesize that damage to the eelgrass roots encourages eelgrass reproduction, thereby improving genetic diversity and the health of the meadows. If, however, other meadows not included in the study are less healthy the larger the local otter population is and the longer the otters have been in residence, that would suggest that damage to the eelgrass roots, which would be expected to increase with the size and residential duration of the otter population, isn't leading meadows to be healthier. Such a finding would therefore weaken Foster's hypothesis. Choice A is incorrect because finding that small, recently introduced otter populations are near other eelgrass meadows in the study wouldn't weaken Foster's hypothesis. If otter populations were small and only recently established, they wouldn't be expected to have caused much damage to eelgrass roots, so even if those eelgrass meadows were less healthy than the Vancouver Island meadows, that wouldn't undermine Foster's hypothesis. In fact, it would be consistent with Foster's hypothesis since it would suggest that the greater damage caused by larger, more established otter populations is associated with healthier meadows. Choice B is incorrect because the existence of areas with otters but without eelgrass meadows wouldn't reveal anything about whether the damage that otters cause to eelgrass roots ultimately benefits eelgrass meadows. Choice D is incorrect because the health of plants other than eelgrass would have no bearing on Foster's hypothesis that damage to eelgrass roots leads to greater genetic diversity and meadow health. It would be possible for otters to have a negative effect on other plants while nevertheless improving the health of eelgrass meadows by damaging eelgrass roots.",

The text describes a disagreement among scholars about whether Mexican American folklore mostly derived from the folklore of Spain (the view held by Espinosa and others) or originated in Mexico and the United States through ongoing cultural interactions there (the view held by Paredes and others). If Mexican American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes's argument by suggesting that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain. Choice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes's view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes's argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore. Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes's argument that the folklore reflects various cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, Paredes would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places. Choice C is incorrect because scholars' previous ignorance of the folklore would have no bearing on Paredes's argument that Mexican American folklore mostly reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States; the folklore's actual origins exist regardless of the scholars' awareness.",

The text indicates that newborn animals of some species are attracted to faces and to stimuli that resemble faces. These species, the text says, share two characteristics: they're social and they practice parental care, meaning that parents care for their young. The text goes on to describe Versace and colleagues' experiment, which showed that Testudo tortoises, which aren't social and don't practice parental care, were attracted to a stimulus that resembles a face. Since Versace and colleagues have shown that a species that isn't social and doesn't practice parental care nevertheless has the innate characteristic of being attracted to face-like stimuli, it follows that this characteristic shouldn't be assumed to be an adaptation related to social interaction or parental care. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that the tortoise hatchlings, which are solitary and don't practice parental care, were attracted to the face-like stimuli, not that they perceived the stimuli as threatening. Choice C is incorrect because the phenomenon discussed in the text is an attraction to faces and face-like stimuli on the part of newborn animals, which can't show any learned characteristics since they were just born. Additionally, the text tells us that the tortoises Versace and colleagues studied aren't social and don't practice parental care, so any findings about those tortoises wouldn't be relevant to the question of whether an attraction to faces in social species that practice parental care is innate or learned. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that adult tortoises were tested on face-like stimuli and, if adults were in fact tested, no information about how they responded is provided. Since no information about adult tortoises' responses is provided, no conclusion comparing those responses to the responses of newly hatched tortoises can be supported.",

The text explains that although synthetic aptamer molecules can be used to test for foodborne bacterial pathogens because they bind to target molecules, it hasn't been clear how likely it is that they will indicate a negative result when a target pathogen is absent in real-world foods. The text then indicates that Somvanshi et al. created test paper that changes from pink to purple when aptamers in it bind to a particular strain of E. coli bacteria, O157:H7, and tested it with store-bought pear juice (that is, a real-world food); the paper changed to purple when exposed to juice to which the target pathogen E. coli O157:H7 had been added, but it remained pink when exposed to juice treated with other E. coli strains or other bacteria species. Based on this result, it seems the aptamers in the paper successfully bound to the target (0157:H7) and the tests had a high degree of specificity (providing negative results for samples where the target was absent even though other bacteria were present) when applied to a real-world food. Choice A is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that E. coli O157:H7 differs from other pathogens in a way that makes it more suitable for aptamer-based testing of any kind and that specificity is likely to be lower when aptamer-based tests target other bacteria; the text simply indicates that Somvanshi et al. used O157:H7 as the target for aptamer-based test paper in their study and suggests that the paper had a high degree of specificity. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the specificity of aptamer-based tests in real-world foods is uncertain for pathogens broadly, not just for E. coli, and similarity between strains (of E. coli or of other pathogens) isn't mentioned. Moreover, the results presented in the text suggest that aptamers are actually capable of distinguishing between strains of E. coli, since Somvanshi et al.'s paper turned purple when exposed to E. coli O157:H7 and remained pink when exposed to other strains. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the aptamers in the test papers didn't bind to different strains of E. coli. The text explains that the test papers turn purple when the aptamers bind to the targeted pathogen and that in the pear juice tests, the test papers turned purple when exposed to samples with the targeted strain of E. coli (0157:H7) but remained pink when exposed to samples with other strains of E. coli. In other words, the aptamers bound only to the targeted strain, not to the other strains. Further, specificity would be affected if the aptamers had bound to multiple strains and not just the targeted one; that result would cause the specificity to be low.",

The sum of the lengths, in centimeters, of all three sides of the triangle can be represented by the expression 4+6+x.

Since it's given that the account balance, A(t), in dollars, after t years can be modeled by an exponential function, it follows that function A can be written in the form A(t)=Nr\\[^t\\], where N is the initial value of the function and r is a constant related to the growth of the function. It's given that the initial balance of the account is $36,100.00, so it follows that the initial value of the function, or N, must be 36,100.00. Substituting 36,100.00 for N in the equation A(t)=Nr\\[^t\\] yields A(t)=36,100.00r\\[^t\\]. It's given that the account balance after 13 years, or when t= 13, is $68,071.93.

Taking the 13th root of both sides of this equation yields r= \\[^{13}\\]\\[\\sqrt{\\]68,071.93/36,100.00\\[}\\], or r is approximately equal to 1.05. Substituting 1.05 for r in the equation A(t)=36,100.00r\\[^t\\] yields A(t)=36,100.00(1.05)\\[^t\\], so the equation A(t)=36,100.00(1.05)\\[^t\\] could define A. Choice B is incorrect. Substituting 0 for t in this function indicates an initial balance of $31,971.93, rather than $36,100.00. Choice C is incorrect. Substituting 0 for t in this function indicates an initial balance of $31,971.93, rather than $36,100.00.

Since \\[\\angle\\]SOP and \\[\\angle\\]ROQ are vertical angles, they are congruent. Therefore, arc PS and arc QR are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Similarly, \\[\\angle\\]SOR and \\[\\angle\\]POQ are vertical angles, so they are congruent. Therefore, arc SR and arc PQ are formed by congruent radii and have the same angle measure, so they are congruent arcs. Let x represent the length of arc SR. Since arc SR and arc PQ are congruent arcs, the length of arc PQ can also be represented by x. It's given that the length of arc PS is twice the length of arc PQ. Therefore, the length of arc PS can be represented by the expression 2x. Since arc PS and arc QR are congruent arcs, the length of arc QR can also be represented by 2x. This gives the expression x+x+2x+2x. Since it's given that the circumference is 144\\[\\pi\\], the expression x+x+2x+ 2x is equal to 144\\[\\pi\\]. Thus x+x+2x+2x=144\\[\\pi\\], or 6x = 144\\[\\pi\\]. Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields x=24\\[\\pi\\]. Therefore, the length of arc QR is 2(24\\[\\pi\\]), or 48\\[\\pi\\].

Substituting - 6 for x in this equation yields y=(-6+6)(-6+5)(-6-4)-3, or y=-3. Substituting - 5 for x in the equation y=(x+6)(x+5)(x-4)-3 yields y=(-5+6)(-5+5)(-5-4)-3, or y=-3.

Therefore, the rate at which the hose puts water in the bucket, in ounces per minute, can be represented by the expression 88x/(5y). Let w represent the number of ounces of water the hose puts in the bucket in 9y minutes at this rate. It follows that the rate at which the hose puts water in the bucket, in ounces per minute, can be represented by the expression w/(9y). The expressions 88x/(5y) and w/(9y) represent the same rate, so it follows that 88x/(5y) = w/(9y). Multiplying both sides of this equation by 9y yields (792xy)/(5y)=w, or 792x/5 = w. Therefore, the number of ounces of water the hose puts in the bucket in 9y minutes can be represented by the expression 792x/5.

A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are distinct and parallel. The graphs of two lines in the xy-plane represented by equations in the form Ax + By= C, where A, B, and C are constants, are parallel if the coefficients for x and y in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation. The first equation in the given system can be written in the form Ax + By = C by subtracting 9y from both sides of the equation to yield 4x-18y=5. The second equation in the given system can be written in the form Ax+By= C by subtracting 4x from both sides of the equation to yield -4x+hy= 2. The coefficient of x in this second equation, -4, is - 1 times the coefficient of x in the first equation, 4. For the lines to be parallel, the coefficient of y in the second equation, h, must also be - 1 times the coefficient of y in the first equation, - 18. Thus, h=-1(-18), or h=18.

The x-coordinates of the x-intercepts of the graph of y=g(x) in the xy-plane can be found by solving the equation 0=x(x+5)(x+4). Applying the zero product property to this equation yields three equations: x=0, x+5=0, and x+4=0. Solving each of these equations for x yields x=0, x=-5, and x=-4, respectively.

The volume of right rectangular prism Y is 1,250 cubic centimeters (cm³). What is the sum of the volumes, in cm³, of right rectangular prism X and right rectangular prism Y?",
      "options": [],
      "correct_answer": "1260",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 1,260. Since it's given that prisms X and Y are similar, all the linear measurements of prism Y are k times the respective linear measurements of prism X, where k is a positive constant. Therefore, the surface area of prism Y is k\\[^2\\] times the surface area of prism X and the volume of prism Y is k\\[^3\\] times the volume of prism X. It's given that the surface area of prism Y is 1,450 cm\\[^2\\], and the surface area of prism X is 58 cm\\[^2\\], which implies that 1,450=58k\\[^2\\]. Dividing both sides of this equation by 58 yields 1,450/58 = k\\[^2\\], or k\\[^2\\] = 25. Since k is a positive constant, k=5. It's given that the volume of prism Y is 1,250 cm\\[^3\\]. Therefore, the volume of prism X is equal to 1,250/k\\[^3\\] cm\\[^3\\], which is equivalent to 1,250/5\\[^3\\] cm\\[^3\\], or 10 cm\\[^3\\]. Thus, the sum of the volumes, in cm\\[^3\\], of the two prisms is 1,250+10, or 1,260.",

The table shows that when t=0, n=604. Substituting 0 for t and 604 for n in the equation n=a(1+b)^t yields 604 = a(1+b)^0, which is equivalent to 604=a(1), or 604 = a. Substituting 604 for a in the equation n=a(1+b)^t yields n=604(1+b)^t. The table also shows that when t=1, n=606.42. Substituting 1 for t and 606.42 for n in the equation n=604(1+b)^t yields 606.42=604(1+b)^1, or 606.42=604(1+b). Dividing both sides of this equation by 604 yields approximately 1.004=1+b. Subtracting 1 from both sides of this equation yields that the value of b is approximately 0.004. Substituting 0.004 for b in the equation n=604(1+b)^t yields n=604(1+0.004)^t. Therefore, of the choices, choice C best represents the relationship between t and n.",

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. All the tables in the choices have the same three values of x, so each of the three values of x can be substituted in the given inequality to compare the corresponding values of y in each of the tables. Substituting 3 for x in the given inequality yields y>13(3)-18, or y>21. Therefore, when x=3, the corresponding value of y is greater than 21. Substituting 5 for x in the given inequality yields y>13(5)-18, or y>47. Therefore, when x=5, the corresponding value of y is greater than 47. Substituting 8 for x in the given inequality yields y>13(8)-18, or y>86. Therefore, when x=8, the corresponding value of y is greater than 86. For the table in choice D, when x=3, the corresponding value of y is 26, which is greater than 21; when x=5, the corresponding value of y is 52, which is greater than 47; when x=8, the corresponding value of y is 91, which is greater than 86. Therefore, the table in choice D gives values of x and their corresponding values of y that are all solutions to the given inequality. Choice A is incorrect. In the table for choice A, when x=3, the corresponding value of y is 21, which is not greater than 21; when x=5, the corresponding value of y is 47, which is not greater than 47; when x=8, the corresponding value of y is 86, which is not greater than 86. Choice B is incorrect. In the table for choice B, when x=5, the corresponding value of y is 42, which is not greater than 47; when x=8, the corresponding value of y is 86, which is not greater than 86. Choice C is incorrect. In the table for choice C, when x=3, the corresponding value of y is 16, which is not greater than 21; when x=5, the corresponding value of y is 42, which is not greater than 47; when x=8, the corresponding value of y is 81, which is not greater than 86.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is correct. When a square is inscribed in a circle, a diagonal of the square is a diameter of the circle. It's given that a square is inscribed in a circle and the length of a radius of the circle is 20√2 inches. Therefore, the length of a diameter of the circle is 2(20√2) inches, or 20√2 inches. It follows that the length of a diagonal of the square is 20√2 inches. A diagonal of a square separates the square into two right triangles in which the legs are the sides of the square and the hypotenuse is a diagonal. Since a square has 4 congruent sides, each of these two right triangles has congruent legs and a hypotenuse of length 20√2 inches. Since each of these two right triangles has congruent legs, they are both 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the length of the hypotenuse is √2 times the length of a leg. Let s represent the length of a leg of one of these 45-45-90 triangles. It follows that 20√2 = √2(s). Dividing both sides of this equation by √2 yields 20=s. Therefore, the length of a leg of one of these 45-45-90 triangles is 20 inches. Since the legs of these two 45-45-90 triangles are the sides of the square, it follows that the side length of the square is 20 inches. Choice B is incorrect. This is the length of a radius, in inches, of the circle. Choice C is incorrect. This is the length of a diameter, in inches, of the circle. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. A y-intercept of a graph in the xy-plane is a point where the graph intersects the y-axis, or a point where x=0. Substituting 0 for x in the equation defining function f yields f(0)=a(2.2^0+2.2^5), or f(0)=a(1+2.2^5). So, the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph is a(1+2.2^5), or equivalently, a+a(2.2^5). It's given that function g is equivalent to function f, where 0<a<b. It follows that k=2.2^5. Since a(2.2^5) can't be equal to 0, the coefficient a can't be equal to a+a(2.2^5). Therefore, function g doesn't display the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=f(x) in the xy-plane as a constant or coefficient. It's also given that function h is equivalent to function f, where 0<a<b. The equation defining f can be rewritten as f(x)=a(2.2^x)+a(2.2^5). It follows that m=a(2.2^5). Since a(2.2^5) can't be equal to 0, the coefficient a can't be equal to a+a(2.2^5). Since 0<a, the constant m, which is equal to a(2.2^5), can't be equal to a+a(2.2^5). Therefore, function h doesn't display the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=f(x) in the xy-plane as a constant or coefficient. Thus, neither function g nor function h displays the y-coordinate of the y-intercept of the graph of y=f(x) in the xy-plane as a constant or coefficient.

Applying the distributive property to the left-hand side of the equation x(kx-56)=-16 yields kx^2-56x=-16. Adding 16 to each side of this equation yields kx^2-56x+16=0. Substituting k for a, -56 for b, and 16 for c in b^2-4ac yields a discriminant of (-56)^2-4(k)(16), or 3,136-64k. If the given equation has no real solution, it follows that the value of 3,136-64k must be negative. Therefore, 3,136-64k<0. Adding 64k to both sides of this inequality yields 3,136<64k.
