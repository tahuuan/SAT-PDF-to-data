      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Ochoa's prediction that humans will one day need to live in places other than Earth. As used in this context, \"speculates\" would mean puts forward an idea without firm evidence. The text states that Ochoa \"doesn't have a definite idea\" about when humans might need to live in other environments and characterizes Ochoa's prediction as a \"conjecture,\" or a conclusion presented without convincing evidence. This context indicates that Ochoa speculates when she makes this prediction.Choice A is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \"demands,\" or insists or requires, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth's wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that she's unsure about the timing but hypothesizes that it will someday happen. Choice C is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \"doubts,\" or questions or disbelieves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth's wouldn't make sense in context. The text indicates that although Ochoa is unsure about the timing, she hypothesizes that humans will need to live in places other than Earth and encourages research into future travel to the moon. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Ochoa \"establishes,\" or proves, that humans will one day need to live in other environments than Earth's wouldn't make sense in context. Rather than stating that Ochoa discusses her idea with certainty and supports it with evidence, the text indicates that Ochoa is unsure about when humans might need to live in other environments.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Annie Dodge Wauneka's work as a Navajo Nation legislator. As used in this context, \"persistent\" means existing continuously. The text states that Wauneka \"continuously worked to promote public health,\" traveling extensively and authoring a medical dictionary; this indicates that Wauneka's effort was persistent.Choice A is incorrect because describing Wauneka's effort related to public health as \"impartial,\" or not partial or biased and treating all things equally, wouldn't make sense in context. The text suggests that Wauneka's continuous work was partial in one way, as she focused specifically on promoting public health throughout the Navajo homeland and to speakers of the Navajo language. Choice B is incorrect because the text emphasizes that Wauneka's effort to promote public health as a Navajo Nation legislator was continuous and extensive, involving wide travels and the authoring of a medical dictionary. Because this work clearly involved care and dedication, it wouldn't make sense to describe it as \"offhand,\" or casual and informal. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Wauneka's effort to promote public health was \"mandatory,\" or required by law or rule, even though Wauneka was a Navajo Nation legislator. Rather than suggesting that Wauneka's effort was required for any reason, the text emphasizes the continuous and extensive nature of her work.",

The text conveys how the Crow Tribe-Montana State University collaboration serves to illustrate the model of community-based participatory research introduced earlier in the text and expanded on later in the text.Choice A is incorrect because referring to \"circumvents,\" or avoids, wouldn't make sense in context. The text suggests that the Crow Tribe-Montana State University collaboration serves as an example of the principles of community-based participatory research, not that the collaboration evades this model. Choice B is incorrect because referring to \"eclipses,\" or overshadows, wouldn't make sense in context. The text describes the Crow Tribe-Montana State University collaboration as an equal partnership, which indicates that it's an example of the community-based participatory research model, not that it overshadows the model.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a relationship between the dodder plant and its host plant. As used in this context, \"synchronization\" means the act of things happening at the same time. The text indicates that the dodder and its host plant flower in unison and that this synchronization occurs because the dodder makes use of a protein produced by the host shortly before flowering.Choice B is incorrect because referring to \"hibernation,\" or the state of being dormant or inactive, wouldn't make sense in context. The text focuses on something the dodder plant actively engages in-making use of a protein and producing flowers. Choice C is incorrect because stating that the dodder plant and its host engage together in \"prediction,\" or the act of declaring or indicating something in advance, wouldn't make sense in context. Rather than indicating that the dodder plant and its host plant make a prediction about flowering activity, the text suggests that the host produces a protein as part of its regular flowering process and that the dodder then absorbs and uses that protein to flower at the same time. Choice D is incorrect because referring to \"moderation,\" or the act of causing something to become less intense or extreme, wouldn't make sense in context. Although the text states that the dodder plant absorbs and uses a protein made by its host plant, it doesn't suggest that the dodder lessens the host plant's flowering activity; the two plants simply flower in unison.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's description of efforts to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems. As used in this context, describing an explanation as \"a straightforward\" one would mean that the explanation is direct and uncomplicated. The text asserts that since it should be \"nearly impossible\" for planets to form in binary star systems, it's \"not surprising\" that there isn't a straightforward explanation for the existence of planets in such systems; the fact that one potential approach involves \"complex\" factors offers further contextual support for this idea.Choice A is incorrect because it would not make sense in context to say that there isn't \"a discernible\" explanation-meaning an explanation capable of being perceived for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text discusses just such an explanation offered by Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee, which indicates that their explanation can be discerned. Choice C is incorrect because the text emphasizes how difficult it is to explain the existence of planets in binary star systems, suggesting that the situation isn't marked by the lack of \"an inconclusive\" explanation-an explanation that does not resolve the issue-but rather that if any explanations have been offered, they've likely been inconclusive ones. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that there is a lack of \"an unbiased,\" or impartial and unprejudiced, explanation for the existence of planets in binary star systems. The text indicates that it's difficult to explain the existence of planets in such systems and it describes one attempt to do so, but there is no evidence that explanations from Roman Rafikov and Kedron Silsbee or others are biased.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Sterlin Harjo's approach to representing Native characters on television. As used in this context, \"repudiates\" means rejects or refuses to have anything to do with. The text indicates that television shows tend to depict Native characters as living long ago, but that Harjo's series Reservation Dogs focuses on Native teenagers in the present day, representing a \"rejection\" of the typical approach to depicting Native characters. This context thus indicates that Harjo repudiates television's general tendency regarding Native characters.Choice B is incorrect because the text describes Harjo's \"rejection\" of the typical approach to representing Native characters on television, so it wouldn't make sense to say that Harjo \"proclaims,\" or declares or affirms, television's general tendency regarding Native characters. Harjo is described as refusing to follow the pattern of depicting Native characters in the distant past, not as proclaiming that pattern. Choice C is incorrect because the text describes television's tendency to represent Native characters in the distant past as something that is already occurring, not as something that Harjo \"foretells,\" or predicts will happen in the future. The text is focused on Harjo's \"rejection\" of this pattern, not on any predictions he may have about it. Choice D is incorrect because saying that Harjo \"recants\" something would mean that he withdraws a previously held belief, and it wouldn't make sense to say that Harjo recants television's tendency to represent Native characters as living in the past. No beliefs previously held by Harjo are mentioned. Additionally, a tendency isn't a belief and thus isn't something that can be recanted.",

The first sentence of the text establishes that Lily can be \"keenly sensitive to\" scenes that serve as a \"fitting background\" for her feelings that is, she's very aware of when a setting seems to reflect her mood. The next sentence, which is underlined, then demonstrates this awareness: Lily views the landscape she's in as a large-scale reflection of her current mood, identifying with elements such as its calmness. Thus, the function of the underlined sentence is to illustrate an idea introduced in the previous sentence.Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes the scene only in very general terms, referring to its calmness, breadth, and long stretches of land. It's the next sentence that adds specific details about colors, light, and various trees nearby. Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the underlined sentence suggests that Lily is experiencing an internal conflict. In fact, the sentence indicates that Lily thinks the landscape reflects her own feeling of calmness. Choice C is incorrect because the only assertion in the underlined sentence is that Lily feels that broad aspects of the landscape, such as its calmness, reflect her current mood, and that assertion isn't expanded on in the next sentence. Instead, the next sentence describes specific details of the scene without connecting them to Lily's feelings.",

The first sentence presents the implications of Veeraraghavan's team's study: sunshine exposure during work hours can cause overly optimistic behavior. The underlined sentence then describes the data the team consulted and how they were used (comparing predictions about earnings to what the companies actually earned), and the final sentence presents what the team found in their examination of the data. Thus, the underlined sentence mainly functions to explain part of the methodology used in the team's study.Choice A is incorrect because the underlined sentence explains in part how the team conducted their analysis of the effect of sunshine but doesn't address what the team found; a broad summary is instead given in the other two sentences. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence doesn't present any specific examples from the team's comparisons of 29,000 earnings predictions to actual earnings; it simply explains in part how the team conducted their analysis.

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it provides the most direct support from the table for the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. The table shows the total number of juvenile plants from five species that were found growing on bare ground and in patches of vegetation as well as the percentage of the total number of each species that were growing in patches of vegetation. For each of the five species, more than 50% of the juvenile plants were growing in patches of vegetation. The text notes, however, that a random distribution of plants across the landscape should result in only about 15% of the plants being found in patches of vegetation. In other words, for each of the five species, the percentage of juvenile plants found growing in patches of vegetation was substantially higher than could be explained by chance alone. This finding supports the claim in the text: if plants growing in patches are overrepresented among plants that have survived to the juvenile stage, as the data show they are, then it suggests that it's advantageous for plants at an early stage of development to grow in patches of vegetation.Choice A is incorrect because the statement that less than 75% of juvenile plants were found growing in patches of vegetation, while true, doesn't clearly support the claim that the plants growing in close proximity to other plants gained an advantage at an early developmental stage. Saying that less than 75% of plants were found in patches doesn't indicate how the percentage growing in patches compares with the percentage that would be expected to grow in patches on the basis of chance alone, which is the information necessary to evaluate whether the claim in the text has support in the table. Put another way, if the percentage of plants found growing in patches was 15% or less, it would be true that less than 75% were found in patches, but the data would in fact weaken the claim in the text, not strengthen it, since the data would show that growing in patches wasn't advantageous. Choice B is incorrect because only 12 plants of this species were found growing in patches, which is the lowest number of any species, not the greatest number. Additionally, even if it were true that this species had the greatest number of plants growing in patches, the finding would be irrelevant to the claim that plants of all five species gained an advantage by growing in close proximity to other plants. Choice C is incorrect because 59.1% of the plants of these species were found growing in patches, which is a far greater percentage, not a lower percentage, than what would be expected if plants were randomly distributed (around 15%). Additionally, if it were true that the percentage of plants growing in patches was lower for these species than what would be expected from chance alone, that finding would weaken, not strengthen, the claim that growing in patches is advantageous.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the researchers' hypothesis about the plants' dependence on dissolving rock. The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorous, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers' hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage-such as access to phosphorous-from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don't benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don't have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn't suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There's no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers' hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn't actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.",

The text goes on to Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Anita Allen's argument about judges citing philosophers in their judicial opinions. The text indicates that judges sometimes cite philosophers when writing their judicial opinions and that, according to Allen, judges tend to cite philosophers whose views are in agreement with those of the judges themselves. Allen claims, however, that the best judicial opinions consider potential objections and rebut them, which suggests that judges may be able to strengthen their opinions by including discussions of philosophers with views contrary to their own. Choice A is incorrect because Allen's claim is that judges could improve their judicial opinions by citing philosophers who disagree with the views expressed in the opinions, which would necessarily require judges to consult philosophical works. Choice C is incorrect because there's no discussion in the text about making judicial opinions more easily understood by any particular group of readers. The focus of the text is on Allen's claim that judicial opinions could be strengthened by the inclusion of discussions of philosophers whose views disagree with those of the judges authoring the opinions. Choice D is incorrect because the text presents Allen's argument that discussing philosophers whose views judges disagree with could strengthen judicial opinions, not that doing so could bring those opinions into line with views that are popular among philosophers.",

The text also presents the critics' view as being influenced by a perception that fine artists create works that are \"timeless\" and meant for exhibition, whereas fashion designers periodically produce new styles that are meant for purchase. This context suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion tend not to overlap‚Äîin other words, that they rarely intersect. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that critics contend that fine art and fashion rarely \"prevail,\" or prove to be triumphant or widespread. The text indicates that Okuma is an example of an artist who demonstrates that it's possible to make fine art that is also available to the public as fashion. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that fine art and fashion rarely \"succumb,\" or surrender. The text establishes that unlike what critics believe, Okuma creates works that are in art museums and available for the public to purchase, suggesting that critics believe fine art and fashion rarely overlap, not that they rarely succumb. Choice C is incorrect because saying that critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely \"diverge,\" or disagree or move in different directions, wouldn't make sense in context. The text presents Okuma's work as both fine art and fashion, thereby undermining what the critics assert. This suggests that the critics believe that fine art and fashion rarely intersect rather than that the two rarely diverge.",

There's no suggestion in the text that the issue of gender roles was inserted between other things or was an interruption in a larger discussion. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been \"socially dictated,\" not expectations that society has \"committed,\" or carried out, entrusted, or promised. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that Shakespeare depicts characters rebelling against expectations about gender that have been \"socially dictated,\" not expectations that have been \"illustrated,‚Äù or clarified with examples.

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately describes the main purpose of the text, which is to show that while Jane calmly goes about her daily tasks, she is experiencing internal agitation about possibly seeking a new job. At the start of the text, Jane says, \"I went on with my day's business tranquilly,\" indicating that she is outwardly calm. This outward calmness is then contrasted with her intense internal restlessness, as Jane says that thoughts of leaving her job keep running through her mind, that she is \"involuntarily framing advertisements\" (meaning that she can't stop herself from thinking up potential listings for jobs), and that she often wonders what new \"situations\" (or jobs) would be like. Choice B is incorrect because the text gives no indication of Jane's feelings, either positive or negative, about the people she works for at Thornfield Hall. And rather than emphasizing that Jane feels particularly loyal to her employers, the text focuses on her constant consideration of leaving her job. Choice C is incorrect because the text gives no indication that Jane finds her current situation fulfilling, or satisfying. Given that much of the text is focused on Jane's thoughts about possibly leaving her job for a new one, it might be the case that she finds her situation challenging, but there is no evidence in the text that Jane also finds that situation satisfying‚Äîshe says nothing positive about her current job at all, in fact. Choice D is incorrect because the text describes Jane as wondering about getting a new job, not as determined to definitely do so. Jane keeps thinking about reasons why she \"should\" quit her current job (indicating that she hasn't yet decided to) and imagining possible new situations she could find, but she says at the end of the text that these thoughts \"might germinate and bear fruit if they could,\" meaning that the thoughts haven't yet led to a decision‚Äîthat Jane isn't yet determined to get a new job somewhere else.",

An especially promising discovery is that both humans and panther worms have a gene for early growth response (EGR) linked to regeneration.\n\nText 2\nWhen Mansi Srivastava and her team reported that panther worms, like humans, possess a gene for EGR, it caused excitement. However, as the team pointed out, the gene likely functions very differently in humans than it does in panther worms.

Text 1 discusses the discovery of a regeneration-linked gene, EGR, in both three-banded panther worms (which are capable of full regeneration) and humans (who have relatively limited regeneration abilities). Text 1 characterizes this discovery as \"especially promising\" and a sign of \"exciting progress\" in understanding human regeneration. The author of Text 2, on the other hand, focuses on the fact that the team that reported the EGR finding pointed out that while EGR's function in humans isn't yet known, it's likely very different from its function in panther worms. Therefore, the author of Text 2 would most likely say that Text 1's enthusiasm about the EGR discovery is overly optimistic given Srivastava's team's observations about EGR in humans. Choice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 explains that Srivastava and her team explicitly reported that they haven't yet identified how EGR functions in humans; therefore, the author of Text 2 wouldn't say that Text 1's excitement is reasonable for the stated reason. Instead, the author of Text 2 would likely characterize Text 1's excitement as premature and overly optimistic. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 does treat Srivastava's team's findings with enthusiasm; it describes the discovery of EGR in both three-banded panther worms and humans as promising and exciting. It would be illogical for the author of Text 2 to say that because most others treat the discovery with enthusiasm, Text 1's enthusiastic characterization of the discovery is unexpected. Choice D is incorrect because Text 1 isn't at all dismissive of Srivastava's team's findings; instead, Text 1 is optimistic about the EGR discovery, characterizing it as promising and exciting. There's nothing in Text 2 to suggest that the author of Text 2 would say that Text 1's praise for the discovery is dismissive, or disdainful.",

The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second. Thus, the description of Vietnamese conveying information at around the same rate that Spanish does despite being spoken more slowly supports the claim in the text that languages can convey the same amount of information even if spoken at different rates. Choice A is incorrect because it isn't true that Thai and Hungarian have the lowest rates of speech of the five languages shown. According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn't support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they're spoken at different rates. Choice C is incorrect because it isn't true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they're spoken at different rates. Choice D is incorrect because it isn't true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.

Piff, Pia Dietze, and colleagues, claims to have found evidence for this effect in a recent study where participants were asked to either gaze up at exceptionally tall trees in a nearby grove (reported to be a universally awe-inspiring experience) or stare at the exterior of a nearby, nondescript building.

According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers' claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did. Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn't have any bearing on the researchers' claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn't address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn't serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn't help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers' claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true‚Äîthat experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn't have any bearing on the researchers' claim about people behaving altruistically.

The text states that over the last two hundred years employment in the agricultural sector has declined while employment in the service sector has risen in both France and the US, and the data from the table reflect these trends. The text asserts, however, that the transition from agriculture to services \"happened at very different rates in the two countries.\" This assertion is best supported by a comparison of data from 1900 and 1950: the table shows that in those years, employment in agriculture went from 43% to 32% in France (a decline of 11 percentage points) and from 41% to 14% in the US (a decline of 27 percentage points), and that employment in services went from 28% to 35% in France (an increase of 7 percentage points) and from 31% to 53% in the US (an increase of 22 percentage points). In other words, the rate of change was greater in the US than in France for both sectors. Choice B is incorrect because comparing the data for 1800 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries, not very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 64% in 1800 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 68% in 1800 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 14% in 1800 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 13% in 1800 to 80% in 2012 in the US. Choice C is incorrect because comparing the data for 1900 and 2012 would suggest a similar rate of change in the two countries rather than very different rates: employment in agriculture went from 43% in 1900 to 3% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 41% in 1900 to 2% in 2012 in the US, while employment in services went from 28% in 1900 to 76% in 2012 in France, which is close to the change from 31% in 1900 to 80% in 2012 in the US.

The text explains that although archaeologists hold that categorizing pottery fragments relies on both objective criteria and instinct developed through direct experience, researchers have found that a computer model can categorize the fragments with the same degree of accuracy as the humans can‚Äîa finding that has caused some archaeologists to worry that their own work won't be needed any longer. If survey results indicate that categorizing pottery fragments limits the amount of time archaeologists can dedicate to other important tasks that only human experts can do, that would mean that computer models aren't able to do all of the important things archaeologists do, thus supporting the researchers' claim that computer models are unlikely to replace human archaeologists. Choice A is incorrect because if it were true that the computer model could categorize the pottery fragments much more quickly than the archaeologists could, that would weaken the researchers' claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models, since it would demonstrate that the models could conduct the archaeologists' work not only with equal accuracy but also at a faster pace. Choice B is incorrect because the inability of both the computer model and the archaeologists to accurately categorize all of the pottery fragments presented wouldn't support the researchers' claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The text indicates that some archaeologists are worried because the computer model's accuracy is equal to their own, and that could be the case whether both were perfectly accurate or were unable to achieve complete accuracy. Choice D is incorrect because survey results showing that few archaeologists received special training in properly categorizing pottery fragments wouldn't support the researchers' claim that archaeologists are unlikely to be replaced by certain computer models. The amount of special training in categorizing pottery fragments that archaeologists have received has no direct bearing on whether computer models' success at categorizing fragments will lead to the models replacing the archaeologists.",

The text also notes that the unusually high representation of military veterans in these jobs may be a result of the organizational structures shared by civilian government entities and the military. Hence, it's reasonable to infer that it's the familiarity of the structures of civilian government that makes jobs there particularly attractive to military veterans. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't address what a typical relationship between military service and later career preferences would be, and there's no indication that it's atypical for veterans to work in civilian government jobs after they've left the military. On the contrary, the text suggests that many military veterans are drawn to such jobs. Choice C is incorrect because the text is focused on the high representation of military veterans in civilian government jobs and doesn't address nonveterans or their possible interest in military service. Choice D is incorrect because the text conveys that military veterans may be particularly interested in civilian government jobs due to the familiarity of organizational structures that are already in place, but there's no reason to think that this interest would mean that more civilian government jobs will start to require military experience.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Shultz's finding about male tanagers. The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benefits, having deeply saturated feathers is usually \"an honest signal\" (a true indication) that a bird is generally fit. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven't consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren't necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager's appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird's overall fitness. Choice A is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids. Choice B is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers' feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it's true, regardless of whether it's actually true. Since there's no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there's no support for the idea that the dishonest signals are less effective than the honest signals. Choice C is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that certain male tanagers may appear to be fitter than they actually are, not that scientists haven't determined why tanagers prefer mates with colorful appearances.",

Since the person intends to spend a maximum of 75 dollars to rent the surfboard, the total cost must be at most 75 dollars. Therefore, the inequality \\(25+10t \\le 75\\) represents this situation. Choice A is incorrect. This represents a situation where the rental fee, not the total cost, is at most 75 dollars. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

Since the number of cells per milliliter doubles every 3 hours, the relationship between x and y can be represented by an exponential equation of the form \\(y = a(b)^{\\frac{x}{k}}\\), where a is the number of cells per milliliter during the initial observation and the number of cells per milliliter increases by a factor of b every k hours. It's given that there were 300,000 cells per milliliter during the initial observation. Therefore, \\(a = 300,000\\). It's also given that the number of cells per milliliter doubles, or increases by a factor of 2, every 3 hours. Therefore, \\(b=2\\) and \\(k = 3\\). Substituting 300,000 for a, 2 for b, and 3 for k in the equation \\(y=a(b)^{\\frac{x}{k}}\\) yields \\(y = 300,000(2)^{\\frac{x}{3}}\\). The number of cells per milliliter there will be 15 hours after the initial observation is the value of y in this equation when \\(x = 15\\). Substituting 15 for x in the equation \\(y = 300,000(2)^{\\frac{x}{3}}\\) yields \\(y = 300,000(2)^{\\frac{15}{3}}\\), or \\(y = 300,000(2)^5\\).

A parabola can intersect a horizontal line at exactly one point only at its vertex. Therefore, the value of c should be equal to the y-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of the given equation. For a quadratic equation in vertex form, \\(y=a(x-h)^2 +k\\), the vertex of its graph in the xy-plane is (h,k).

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The two given equations are equivalent because the second equation can be obtained from the first equation by multiplying each side of the equation by 5. Thus, the graphs of the equations are coincident, so if a point lies on the graph of one of the equations, it also lies on the graph of the other equation. A point (x,y) lies on the graph of an equation in the xy-plane if and only if this point represents a solution to the equation. It is sufficient, therefore, to find the point that represents a solution to the first given equation. Substituting the x- and y-coordinates of choice B, \\(-\\frac{3r}{2}+2\\) and r, for x and y, respectively, in the first equation yields \\(2(-\\frac{3r}{2}+2)+3r=7\\), which is equivalent to \\(-3r+7+3r=7\\), or \\(7=7\\).

      "options": [],
      "correct_answer": "104",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is 104. An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides have the same length and all three angles have a measure of 60¬∞. The height of the triangle, \\(k\\sqrt{3}\\), is the length of the altitude from one vertex. The altitude divides the equilateral triangle into two congruent 30-60-90 right triangles, where the altitude is the side across from the 60¬∞ angle in each 30-60-90 right triangle. Since the altitude has a length of \\(k\\sqrt{3}\\), it follows from the properties of 30-60-90 right triangles that the side across from each 30¬∞ angle has a length of k and each hypotenuse has a length of 2k. In this case, the hypotenuse of each 30-60-90 right triangle is a side of the equilateral triangle; therefore, each side length of the equilateral triangle is 2k. The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of each side. It's given that the perimeter of the equilateral triangle is 624; therefore, \\(2k+2k+2k = 624\\), or \\(6k=624\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 6 yields \\(k=104\\).",

Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 results in x = -27. Therefore, the two values of x-1 are 29-1, or 28, and -27-1, or -28. Thus, the positive value of x-1 is 28. Alternate approach: The given equation can be rewritten as |4(x‚àí1)|=112, which is equivalent to 4|x-1|=112. Dividing both sides of this equation by 4 yields |x-1| = 28.

Therefore, the volume of the given cube is V = 68^3, or 314,432 cubic inches. The volume of a sphere can be found by using the formula V = (4/3)œÄr^3, where V is the volume and r is the radius of the sphere. Therefore, the volume of the given sphere is V = (4/3)œÄ(34)^3, or approximately 164,636 cubic inches. The volume of the space in the cube not taken up by the sphere is the difference between the volume of the cube and volume of the sphere. Subtracting the approximate volume of the sphere from the volume of the cube gives 314,432-164,636=149,796 cubic inches. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. The standard form of an equation of a circle in the xy-plane is (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2, where the coordinates of the center of the circle are (h,k) and the length of the radius of the circle is r. For the circle in the xy-plane with equation (x-5)^2+(y-3)^2 = 16, it follows that r^2 = 16. Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields r = 4 or r=-4. Because r represents the length of the radius of the circle and this length must be positive, r = 4. Therefore, the radius of the circle is 4. The diameter of a circle is twice the length of the radius of the circle. Thus, 2(4) yields 8. Therefore, the diameter of the circle is 8. Choice A is incorrect. This is the radius of the circle. Choice C is incorrect. This is the square of the radius of the circle. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Since the model estimates that the number of squirrels in the population increased by a fixed percentage, 150%, each year, the model can be represented by an exponential equation of the form n=a(1+p/100)^t, where a is the estimated number of squirrels in the population at the end of 2015, and the model estimates that at the end of each year, the number is p% more than the number at the end of the previous year. Since the model estimates that at the end of each year, the number was 150% more than the number at the end of the previous year, p=150. Substituting 150 for p in the equation n=a(1+p/100)^t yields n = a(1+150/100)^t which is equivalent to n=a(1+1.5)^t, or n=a(2.5)^t. It's given that the estimated number of squirrels at the end of 2016 was 180. This means that when t = 1, n=180. Substituting 1 for t and 180 for n in the equation n=a(2.5)^t yields 180=a(2.5)^1, or 180=2.5a. Dividing each side of this equation by 2.5 yields 72=a. Substituting 72 for a in the equation n=a(2.5)^t yields n=72(2.5)^t. Choice A is incorrect. This equation represents a model where at the end of each year, the estimated number of squirrels was 150% of, not 150% more than, the estimated number at the end of the previous year. Choice C is incorrect. This equation represents a model where at the end of each year, the estimated number of squirrels was 150% of, not 150% more than, the estimated number at the end of the previous year, and the estimated number of squirrels at the end of 2015, not the end of 2016, was 180.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Two lines are perpendicular if their slopes are negative reciprocals, meaning that the slope of the first line is equal to -1 divided by the slope of the second line. Each equation in the given pair of equations can be written in slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, where m is the slope of the graph of the equation in the xy-plane and (0,b) is the y-intercept. For the first equation, 5x+7y = 1, subtracting 5x from both sides gives 7y = -5x+1, and dividing both sides of this equation by 7 gives y=-5/7x+1/7. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is -5/7. For the second equation, ax+by=1, subtracting ax from both sides gives by =-ax+1, and dividing both sides of this equation by b gives y=-a/bx+1/b. Therefore, the slope of the graph of this equation is -a/b. Since the graph of the given pair of equations is a pair of perpendicular lines, the slope of the graph of the second equation, -a/b, must be the negative reciprocal of the slope of the graph of the first equation, -5/7. The negative reciprocal of -5/7 is 1/(-(-5/7)) or 7/5. Therefore, -a/b = 7/5, or a/b = -7/5. Similarly, rewriting the equations in choice B in slope-intercept form yields y=-7/10x+1/10 and y=-a/2bx+1/2b. It follows that the slope of the graph of the first equation in choice B is -7/10 and the slope of the graph of the second equation in choice B is -a/2b. Since -a/2b is equal to -1/(-7/10), or 10/7. Since 10/7 is the negative reciprocal of -7/10, the pair of equations in choice B represents a pair of perpendicular lines.",

In the given equation, x^2 ‚àí34x+c=0, a=1 and b=-34. Therefore, the discriminant of the given equation can be expressed as (-34)^2-4(1)(c), or 1,156-4c.
