      "question_text": "The following text is from the 1913 story “The King's Coin\" by Emily Pauline Johnson, a Kanienkahagen (Mohawk) writer also known as Tekahionwake. Fox-Foot, a young Ojibwe man, is guiding a group of fur traders who are traveling by canoe and suspects that they are being followed.\n\nAt supper time, Fox-Foot would allow no fire to be built, no landing to be made, no trace of their passing to be left. They ate canned meat and marmalade, drank again of the stream and pushed on, until just at dusk they reached the edge of a long, still lake, with shores of granite and dense fir forest.\n\nAs used in the text, what does the word \"trace\" most nearly mean?",

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because the text indicates that Fox-Foot doesn't let the group build a fire or create a canoe landing when it's time for supper. This context suggests that he doesn't want anyone who might be following the group to see any sign of them or their activities. In other words, Fox-Foot doesn't want there to be any trace, or evidence, of the group's movements (\"their passing\") through the area.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text conveys that Fox-Foot doesn't want the group to be detected, not that he doesn't want their presence to create a blemish, or a spoiling flaw, in the area; human activity could disturb a natural environment, but the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is instead focused on avoiding giving any sign of the group's movements through a place (\"their passing\") to anyone who might be following them. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on Fox-Foot's desire to avoid detection by those who might be following the group. This context conveys that Fox-Foot doesn't want to create any signs or evidence of the group moving through a place (\"their passing\"), not that he doesn't want to leave behind some quantity of their presence; indeed, it isn't clear what an amount of a group's movement would be. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the group has a sketch, or rough drawing, of their movements through that area (\"their passing\") that might be left behind. Rather, the context emphasizes that Fox-Foot is focused on ensuring that the group doesn't give any kind of indication of their presence, as he wants to avoid detection by anyone who might be following the group.",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of noses on ancient sculptures. In this context, \"fragile\" means weak or delicate. This matches the text's description of noses on ancient sculptures, which are often missing from sculptures' heads because they are \"especially easy to break.\" Therefore, this context indicates that noses on ancient sculptures are the most fragile part of the sculptures' heads.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"recognizable\" would mean identifiable, and since the text indicates that noses are often missing from ancient statues, they therefore cannot be the most recognizable part of the statue. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many ancient statues are missing noses, so noses wouldn't be \"common,\" or frequent, aspects of ancient statues; they would conversely be uncommon. Choice D is incorrect because the text only indicates that noses on ancient statues often stick out and end up missing from the heads, which doesn't relate to the noses being \"sophisticated,\" or knowledgeable or refined.",

          "text": "perpetual"
        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of advance indications of solar flares. In this context the word \"impending\" means imminent or approaching. The text mentions a study by Leka and colleagues that found that the Sun's corona provides an advance indication of solar flares. The text then points out why such an advance indication would be useful—solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth—and concludes by describing the characteristic of the corona that gives warning of a solar flare. The text indicates that this characteristic—increased brightness in a particular region of the corona—comes before the appearance of the flare. Therefore, in context, the best answer would indicate that the flare is approaching, or impending.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The best answer would be one that indicates that the increased brightness of the Sun's corona precedes the appearance of the flare. But if the flare were \"antecedent,\" or previous, then the flare would instead precede the appearance of the increased brightness of the corona, a statement that is logically inconsistent. Choice C is incorrect. The word \"innocuous,\" or harmless, does not logically complete the text; since solar flares can interfere with communications on Earth, they cannot reasonably be described as innocuous. Choice D is incorrect. If the solar flares have an advance indication of their appearance, then there must therefore be a time before the appearance of the flares when they do not exist. But the word \"perpetual,\" or never-ending, would in context indicate that the flare exists at the same time as the advance indication provided by the Sun's corona, which would not make logical sense.",

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of using magnetism to detect stress in buried metal pipes. In this context, \"exploited\" means made productive use of. The text indicates that the magnetic fields of some metals change under stress and that Saleem and colleagues showed that it is possible to measure those changes from a distance, thereby demonstrating that the integrity of underground metal pipes can be evaluated without having to unearth them. This context thus indicates that Saleem and colleagues made productive use of, or exploited, this tendency of the metals' magnetic fields.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"hypothesized\" would mean made a tentative assumption to be evaluated in a study or experiment. Although Saleem and colleagues may have had one or more hypotheses for these experiments, the text presents the information about the tendency of some metals' magnetic fields to change under stress as a known fact that the researchers made productive use of, not as a hypothesis to be evaluated. The text after the colon indicates that the researchers were not evaluating whether such changes occur but whether those changes can be measured at a distance. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"discounted\" would mean downplayed or ignored, but the text does not suggest that Saleem and colleagues minimized or ignored the tendency of the magnetic fields of some metals to change under stress. Rather, the text indicates that this tendency is the basis for Saleem and colleagues' method of assessing the pipes' integrity. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text indicates that Saleem and colleagues \"redefined,\" or reevaluated or reformulated, the tendency of some metals' magnetic fields to change under stress. Instead, the text indicates that the researchers made use of that tendency to demonstrate that it is possible to evaluate the integrity of underground pipes without unearthing them.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of behavioral psychology studies. In this context, \"ameliorate\" means to help remedy or improve. The text states that many behavioral psychology studies are flawed because the subjects used are \"highly unrepresentative.\" It is then suggested that researchers should recruit subjects from \"diverse backgrounds and locations\" in order to help address the issue of unrepresentative subject pools. Thus, this context conveys that recruitment efforts focused on diversity would help ameliorate the problems outlined in the text.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"sanction\" could have two meanings: to give official approval for something or to enact a penalty, neither of which makes sense in this context. The text describes a situation known to be problematic in behavioral psychology studies and then presents a potential remedy to that situation; the text does not suggest that the situation is officially approved or results in any type of penalty. Choice C is incorrect because rather than \"rationalize,\" or explain or justify, a situation, the text presents a situation and its potential remedy. Choice D is incorrect because the text is not attempting to \"postulate,\" or suggest a claim or theory, related to the situation described in the text but is rather presenting a potential remedy for the situation.",

The remainder of the text explains that the researchers hope their work in Atacama will support inquiry into life on Mars. Thus, the underlined portion functions mainly to indicate why astrobiologists choose to conduct research in the Atacama Desert.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because to contrast two things means to show the differences between them, and the phrase \"closely mirrors\" in the underlined sentence indicates that the extreme environment in the Atacama Desert is similar to, not different from, that on Mars.

The first sentence explains that reproducing the high ridership of Mexico City's public transit system in other cities by implementing some of its features, such as its low fares, is unlikely to guarantee significant ridership increases in those cities. The following sentence introduces a study by Guerra et al., whose findings—namely that choice of transportation mode in urban centers in Mexico is influenced by a variety of local contextual factors—support this claim. The first part of the last sentence concedes that features of transportation systems likely do have some effect on ridership numbers, but the underlined portion reiterates the study's conclusion by stating that there is an \"irreducibly contextual dimension\" to peoples' choice to use public transportation: that is, there is a complex mix of local contextual factors—including population density, spatial distribution of jobs, and demographics—whose influence over an urban center's transit ridership is unique to each location, and it is unlikely that simple changes to transit system characteristics could negate the influence of those contextual factors. Thus, the underlined portion explains why it is challenging to influence transit ridership solely by changing some of a transit system's characteristics.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Rather than objecting to the argument of Guerra et al., the underlined portion reiterates their argument by stating that there is an \"irreducibly contextual dimension\" involved in transportation mode choice; in other words, transportation mode choice in urban areas of Mexico is strongly dependent on contextual factors that are unique to each urban area. Choice C is incorrect because it mischaracterizes the text's central claim, which is that transit ridership is the product of a complex mix of contextual factors and transit system features, not that a characteristic associated with Mexico City's high transit ridership was found to have no association with high transit ridership elsewhere. Additionally, the underlined portion does not illustrate a claim, but instead restates the findings of Guerra et al. Choice D is incorrect. Although Guerra et al. demonstrate that population density, the spatial distribution of jobs, and demographic characteristics—factors that comprise the \"contextual dimension of transportation mode choice\"—influence transit ridership, the underlined portion does not substantiate—that is, provide evidence in support of—this assertion. Rather, the underlined portion merely restates a study finding that explains why simply altering a transit system's features would be unlikely to induce significant increases in transit ridership.",

      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most accurately describes the overall structure of the text. The text begins by explaining that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in soil, but how deeply these effects are seen in the soil remains an unresolved question. Next, the text summarizes Okolo and colleagues' hypothesis regarding this question—which is that the different effects on carbon and nitrogen levels associated with different types of land use would also be observed below the topsoil layer—and then briefly explains the methods they used to test this hypothesis. Finally, the text states that the researchers found that at depths below the topsoil layer, carbon and nitrogen decreased to similarly low levels across all land-use types, a finding that conflicts with the team's hypothesis presented earlier in the text. Thus, the text introduces an unresolved scientific question, presents a research team's hypothesis pertaining to that question, and then describes an observation that the team made that conflicted with their hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the text introduces a phenomenon (the fact that human activities influence carbon and nitrogen levels in the soil) that isn't fully understood by scientists and explains a research team's hypothesis about the phenomenon, the text doesn't describe how the team refined their hypothesis when a research finding contradicted it. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't discuss a process at all; rather, it poses an unsolved scientific question and presents a hypothesis that Okolo and colleagues tested to answer that question. Moreover, the text only describes one hypothesis; it doesn't mention any competing hypotheses, nor does it suggest that Okolo's team was able to determine which hypothesis was correct. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't begin by presenting a hypothesis that is under scientific debate; rather, it presents a question that scientists have been unable to answer and then introduces a hypothesis formulated by Okolo and colleagues. While the text does explain how Okolo's team tested their hypothesis, the text goes on to say that their data conflicted with their hypothesis, not that the data validated, or supported, their hypothesis.",

The graph shows the ratio of manganese to calcium in \\textit{L. pertusa} coral samples from the Alboran Sea and the Mauritanian coast. The graph reflects time in approximate years before present: in other words, the greater the number in years noted on the graph's horizontal axis, the farther that moment is in the past. The text indicates that the researchers tested the samples to determine whether oxygenation played a role in the decline of \\textit{L. pertusa}. The text goes on to note that a change in the ratio of manganese to calcium would signal an inverse, or opposite, change in oxygenation. According to the graph, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Alboran Sea increased from about 30 micromoles per mole 10,000 years ago to about 80 micromoles per mole 8,000 years ago, which means that oxygenation decreased between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago. Meanwhile, there was almost no discernible change in the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from the Mauritanian coast between 12,000 and 10,000 years ago. According to the text, the population of \\textit{L. pertusa} declined significantly around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea and around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. Thus, the increase in the ratio of manganese to calcium around 9,000 years ago in the Alboran Sea coincides with the decline in the \\textit{L. pertusa} population, suggesting an association between the decrease in oxygenation and the decline in population of the coral. No such relationship is suggested around 11,000 years ago near the Mauritanian coast. So, oxygenation likely played a role in the \\textit{L. pertusa} decline in the Alboran Sea but not in the coral's decline near the Mauritanian coast.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it asserts the opposite of what the graph indicates regarding oxygenation in the Alboran Sea, and it misrepresents what the graph indicates about oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast. The graph indicates that at the time of the decline in \\textit{L. pertusa} (approximately 9,000 years ago), the samples from the Alboran Sea contained a ratio of manganese to calcium that was increasing. According to the text, this ratio inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, so if the ratio was increasing, oxygenation was decreasing, not substantially increasing. Furthermore, the graph shows that the ratio of manganese to calcium remained relatively stable in coral samples from the Mauritanian coast during the period studied, which suggests that there was no discernible relationship between oxygenation and the coral's population decline in that location, not that there was a substantial decrease in oxygenation corresponding to the coral's decline. Choice C is incorrect. Although the graph suggests that the level of oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was higher before the decline in \\textit{L. pertusa} than after—because the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels and this ratio was lower before the decline than after—the graph doesn't support the claim that oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low before and after the coral's decline there. Rather, the graph indicates that relative to coral samples from the Alboran Sea, the ratio of manganese to calcium in samples from near the Mauritanian coast was consistently low, which suggests that oxygenation levels were relatively high both before and after the decline of \\textit{L. pertusa}. Choice D is incorrect because it states the opposite of what the graph indicates: the graph shows that throughout the period studied, the ratio of manganese to calcium was higher in coral samples from the Alboran Sea than it was in samples from near the Mauritanian coast. Since the text indicates that the ratio of manganese to calcium inversely correlates with ocean oxygenation levels, oxygenation in the Alboran Sea was therefore lower than, not higher than, oxygenation near the Mauritanian coast during the period studied. Moreover, even if choice D did accurately represent the graph, it wouldn't effectively complete the statement since a comparison of the ocean oxygenation levels at the two locations is not relevant to the claim that a decline in oxygenation levels was associated with the decline of \\textit{L. pertusa} in the Alboran Sea but not near the Mauritanian coast.",

According to the text, some scientists believe that a comet fragment hitting Earth caused the cooling of the Younger Dryas period to come about. The text then indicates that a team of scientists found a crater in Greenland, which some believe supports the theory of a comet fragment hitting Earth to initiate the Younger Dryas. However, the text also notes that the team was unable to determine the age of the crater. If the age of the crater can't be determined, then its connection to the Younger Dryas period of time can't be confirmed either. Thus, it can't be concluded that the impact that made the crater was connected to the beginning of the Younger Dryas.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because though the text suggests that the age of the comet crater found by a team of scientists is uncertain, it doesn't address whether a comet fragment can make a crater as large as 19 miles wide. The text doesn't consider the size of comet fragments and how they relate to the size of craters they might make. Choice C is incorrect because the debate in the text centers on the age of the crater found, not the cause of the crater. The text doesn't indicate uncertainty about what caused the discovered crater. Choice D is incorrect because the text suggests that the age of the crater found by the team of scientists is uncertain, not that the dates of the Younger Dryas are uncertain or incorrect. The text states that \"the Younger Dryas was a period of extreme cooling from 11,700 to 12,900 years ago\" but doesn't indicate any debate about the timing of the period.",

Furthermore, the text states that species that possess an appendix also tend to have relatively high amounts of lymphoid tissue—a type of tissue that supports immune system function. Taken together, these details strongly support the hypothesis that the appendix has persisted in some species because it has a function that contributes to effective immune responses in those species.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't address any nonmammalian species. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't make predictions about the evolutionary future of the species Smith and colleagues examined, and although the implication of the text is that the appendix likely does serve a function for the immune system, nothing in the text indicates that the appendix will become more widespread in the future. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text does suggest an association between having an appendix and relatively high concentrations of lymphoid tissue, it doesn't claim that the appendix causes the tissue to grow, nor does it address the relative production of the tissue at different periods of time.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion about Aztec (Nahua) ethics. The text indicates that, according to Purcell's interpretation of available Aztec philosophical works, the Aztec ethical system views an individual's actions in relation to that individual's societal role and how the actions affect the community. The text contrasts this view with another held by some ethicists, namely that actions are morally good or bad regardless of the context in which they occur. Thus, Purcell's analysis suggests that the Aztecs would have asserted that the morality of an individual's actions are rooted in that person's position in the community and the actions' effects and therefore cannot be determined in the absence of that context.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that morally judging an action according to Aztec ethics requires an understanding of the action's effects and the individual's social circumstances, it does not specify that only members of that society can acquire this information. Choice C is incorrect because it implies that the Aztecs considered some actions good or bad regardless of the surrounding context, which contradicts the text's claim that the Aztecs believed that the morality of an individual's action is dependent on the action's effects on the community and the person's specific circumstances. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text indicates that in Aztec ethics the morality of an action depends in part on how it affects the community, this is only one of the two factors—the other being the person's societal role—that need to be considered. Therefore, it is possible that two actions with the same effect on the community could be considered morally distinct if they are performed by individuals in different social roles.",

The comma after \"described\" separates the first supplementary element (\"both of interviewees and the items they described\") from the second supplementary element (\"from hair to grass to sculptures\"). Furthermore, the dash after \"sculptures\" pairs with the dash after \"photographs\" to separate these two supplementary elements from the rest of the sentence. The pair of dashes, which operate at a higher organizing level than the comma, indicates that the elements between the dashes function together— in this case, the second supplement (\"from...sculptures\") describes the range of items mentioned in the first supplement—and could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. A dash is needed after \"sculptures\" to separate the supplementary elements (\"both...sculptures\") from the rest of the sentence. Choice C is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. The two supplementary elements \"both...described\" and \"from...sculptures\" function together to describe the photographs, and placing a dash between them would make this relationship less clear, suggesting that the supplement \"both...described\" is a standalone element that could be removed without affecting the grammatical coherence of the sentence, which isn't the case. Choice D is incorrect because it fails to appropriately punctuate the supplementary elements in the sentence. A colon isn't conventionally used in this way to separate a supplementary element (\"from hair to grass to sculptures\") from the noun phrase it is modifying (\"items they described\"). Additionally, a dash is needed after \"sculptures\" to separate the supplementary elements (\"both...sculptures\") from the rest of the sentence.",

The text presents the finding from a team of neuroeconomists that decision making may be connected to communication between the prefrontal cortex and the parietal cortex. In presenting this finding, the text suggests a contrast between people who tend to be more decisive and people who make decisions more slowly. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between the two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. On the other hand, this context suggests that people make choices more slowly when the flow of information between the two brain regions is decreased. Choice B is incorrect because \"evaluated\" means assessed, which wouldn't make sense in context. According to the text, people tend to be more decisive when the flow of information between two brain regions is intensified, or strengthened. This suggests that people's ease of decision making varies based on the rate of information traveling between the regions, not based on an effort to assess the information.

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the significance of the War of 1812 in British historical memory. In this context, \"tenuous\" means vulnerable or uncertain. The text indicates that the War of 1812 was both smaller, and less prominent, than the conflict with France, and resulted in no significant geopolitical changes. These details imply that the War of 1812 is less likely than other British historical events to be remembered, giving the War of 1812 a tenuous place in British historical memory. Choice B is incorrect because in this context \"enduring\" would mean lasting or durable, but the text describes the War of 1812 as being overshadowed by, and smaller than, the simultaneous conflict with France. This seems to conflict with the notion that the War of 1812 has an enduring place in British historical memory. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"contentious\" would mean likely to cause disagreement, and while there likely are contentious issues related to the War of 1812, nothing in the text discusses or implies any such disagreement. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"conspicuous\" would mean obvious, but the text describes the War of 1812 as being overshadowed by, and smaller than, the simultaneous conflict with France. Rather than suggesting that the War of 1812 has a conspicuous place in British historical memory, these descriptions suggest that its place is not particularly obvious.",

In this context, \"defend\" means support in the face of argument. The overall focus of the text is on the difficulty of determining what bull-leaping rituals meant to the Minoans, about whom, the text indicates, we know very little. The text states that because of this scarcity of information, assertions about the meaning of the rituals, which took place a very long time ago (in the second millennium BCE), are highly likely to be based on speculation and guesswork. This context suggests that claims about the meaning of the rituals are difficult to successfully support, or defend. Choice A is incorrect because \"imagine\" in this context would mean form a mental image of something. Although it's possible to imagine what Minoan bull-leaping rituals might have looked like, the focus of the text isn't on how the rituals looked but rather on claims about them, which the text suggests are difficult to support because very little is known about the Minoans. Choice B is incorrect because \"summarize\" in this context would mean recap or outline, neither of which makes sense. The text indicates that claims about the significance of Minoan bull-leaping rituals will inevitably rely on speculation and guesswork because very little is known about the Minoans. This suggests that claims about the Minoan rituals are difficult to support in the face of argument, not that they're difficult to recap or outline. Choice D is incorrect because \"adjust\" in this context would mean modify or correct. Although a claim about a ritual's meaning could be modified or corrected based on newly discovered evidence, the text doesn't focus on any specific claims made about the significance of Minoan bull-leaping rituals. Rather, the text focuses on the feasibility of making valid claims about the rituals in general, suggesting that the scarcity of information about the Minoans makes it difficult to support any claims about the rituals.",

In the text, Harris tells stories about his previous boat trip across the English Channel, when conditions were so rough that others onboard became seasick. According to the text, Harris's accounts vary somewhat but generally involve him and only one other man not growing ill. The underlined sentence then adds that if it was \"not [Harris] and another man\" who didn't develop seasickness, \"then it was [Harris] by himself.\" That is, some versions of the story even involve Harris being the only person onboard who resisted seasickness. Therefore, the underlined sentence emphasizes that Harris always boasts about his own constitution, or physical well-being, when speaking of a previous boat trip. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't portray Harris as being eager to resume traveling; instead, it shows Harris boasting of how he didn't become seasick on a previous boat trip when most or all of the other people onboard did. Choice B is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Harris felt excluded from activities during an earlier boat trip. The text suggests that Harris experienced isolation during that trip because others onboard had grown ill, not because Harris had wanted to join certain activities but felt left out. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't portray Harris as either enjoying company or claiming to prefer solitude. The text suggests that Harris experienced some degree of isolation during a previous boat trip, but the reason provided by the text has nothing to do with a preference for either solitude or the opposite; rather, the reason, according to Harris, is that most or all of the other people onboard were sick.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most accurately states how the author of Text 2 would most likely respond to the argument presented in Text 1. In arguing that graphic novels shouldn't be classified as literature and are more comparable to film, Text 1 claims that language plays a relatively limited role in graphic novels: images, not language, are the primary means by which graphic novels tell their stories, and language is used \"only sparingly\"—that is, comparatively very little—in the form of captions and dialogue. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that language in graphic novels is as equally vital for conveying meaning as images are, since without captions and dialogue, readers wouldn't be able to make sense of the narrative. Moreover, the author of Text 2 argues that there are many graphic novels that are \"beautifully written\" and whose use of language is as accomplished as any standard novel. Because Text 1 argues that language is subordinate to images in graphic novels, whereas Text 2 highlights how language is an essential component of a graphic novel's storytelling, it can reasonably be inferred that the author of Text 2 would say that language plays a more important role in graphic novels than the author of Text 1 recognizes. Choice B is incorrect. Although Text 1 indicates that graphic novels shouldn't be classified as literature based on their limited use of language, there's no indication that the author of Text 1 considers this limited use of language as a flaw, just that it doesn't fit the particular definition of \"literature\" proposed in the text. Even if Text 1 had suggested that their use of language was a common flaw of graphic novels, the author of Text 2 emphasizes how many graphic novels are \"beautifully written,\" and would therefore say that their use of language is exemplary, not that it is flawed. Choice C is incorrect because Text 1 doesn't claim that the story lines of graphic novels are generally relatively easy to understand; in addition, Text 2 argues that given their dependence on the interaction of image and text, the stories of graphic novels would be incomprehensible if their captions and dialogue were removed, not that the story lines of some graphic novels are more difficult to understand than Text 1 acknowledges. Choice D is incorrect because the author of Text 1 doesn't imply that graphic novels aren't well crafted, only that they use language too sparingly to fit the definition of \"literature,\" and that their use of images to convey stories makes them more comparable to film than to literature. Even if the author of Text 1 had implied that most graphic novels aren't well crafted, Text 2 refers to the fact that many graphic novels are as beautifully written—that is, well crafted—as many standard novels; thus, it wouldn't be accurate to say that the author of Text 2 would agree with the author of Text 1 that most graphic novels aren't well crafted.",

The text states that Boeri's design for Bosco Verticale features hundreds of trees on balconies and is intended to serve as a model for promoting urban biodiversity. But the text goes on to state that some critics believe that it is too early to determine if the trees planted on Bosco Verticale can thrive there. Therefore, according to the text, critics are skeptical of the concept behind Bosco Verticale because it is unclear whether Bosco Verticale can support the plant life included in its design. Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri's goals was for Bosco Verticale to serve as a model for promoting biodiversity in architecture, which suggests that Boeri would likely support the idea of reproducing the same concept in other locations, the text does not discuss whether it is feasible to adapt the design to locations other than Milan. Instead, the text describes critics' concerns that the plant life that currently exists on Bosco Verticale might not thrive in its current setting. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that one of Boeri's goals in creating Bosco Verticale was to promote biodiversity, which implies a goal of including varied plant life in the design, it does not mention whether the hundreds of trees that were planted on its balconies failed to meet this goal. Rather, the text states that some critics are concerned that the trees on Bosco Verticale's balconies may not thrive in this setting. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not mention how Bosco Verticale was constructed, let alone how environmentally destructive its construction may have been relative to the construction of more conventional buildings.",

The text then discusses how Mikhail Bakhtin, a literary theorist, argued that \\textit{fabula} and \\textit{syuzhet} can't fully describe a narrative, since systematic categorizations such as these fail to account for all the ways in which interactions between the artist, the work, and the audience produce meaning. Thus, the main idea is that Bakhtin argued that there are important characteristics of narratives that are not fully encompassed by two concepts that other theorists have used to analyze narratives. Choice B is incorrect because according to the text, Mikhail Bakhtin believed that meaning was created through the interactions of the artist, narrative, and audience, not simply through the interaction between the audience and narrative; moreover, the text doesn't address whether Bakhtin focused on the ways in which different people interpret narratives differently.

The bar graph shows the growth of sugar maple trees with and without nitrogen fertilization under three different climate-change scenarios: current conditions, a moderate change, and an extreme change. According to the graph, radial growth without nitrogen fertilization is projected to be about 0.16 centimeters (cm) under current conditions, 0.15 cm under a moderate change, and 0.04 cm under an extreme change. The graph also shows that with nitrogen fertilization, growth is projected to be about 0.18 centimeters under a moderate change but only about 0.06 centimeters under an extreme change.

This conclusion is supported by data from the researchers' simulations of changes in annual irrigation output in two different scenarios-one in which an area's annual precipitation is already somewhat concentrated and one in which its annual precipitation is evenly distributed. The table shows that if baseline precipitation is somewhat concentrated, water use for irrigation will increase only slightly, whereas if baseline precipitation is evenly distributed, water use for irrigation will increase much more-9.0% for surface water and 7.9% for groundwater. This difference illustrates the researchers' conclusion that the amount of additional water needed for irrigation will vary greatly depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it compares changes in the amount of water being used for irrigation to changes in the amount of water entering aquifers. Persad and her colleagues' conclusion doesn't focus on changes to the amount of water entering aquifers; rather, the researchers' conclusion focuses on changes to irrigation output relative to how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area is. Choice C is incorrect because it supports only part of Persad and her colleagues' conclusion. According to the text, the researchers concluded that the concentration of precipitation into fewer events will trigger more irrigation but that this change in irrigation output will be highly sensitive to an area's baseline concentration of annual precipitation. The data in this choice support the idea that more irrigation will be needed, but to support the rest of the researchers' conclusion, additional data from the table are required to show that the increases in water use for irrigation will vary depending on how concentrated or spread out the annual precipitation in an area already is. Choice D is incorrect because data in the table indicate no declines in water use for irrigation, showing only increases in the form of positive values.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of English dialects spoken in Scotland and the Upland South. The text indicates that these dialects share a feature: putting emphasis on the \"r\" sound when it appears in certain positions in words. The text goes on to state that records indicate the Upland South was colonized largely by people of Scottish ancestry. It is reasonable to assume that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers were influenced by the English dialects spoken by their ancestors in Scotland. It follows, then, that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in the dialects in Scotland carried over into the Upland South dialects as they developed that is, that the Upland South dialects likely acquired it from dialects spoken in Scotland.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Scottish ancestry explains the origin of the emphasis on the \"r\" sound in English dialects spoken in the Upland South, since that linguistic feature is also found in dialects spoken in Scotland; the text doesn't address any other dialects or suggest that the feature will spread elsewhere. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that many Upland South colonizers were the descendants of Scottish people, suggesting that the English dialects spoken by these colonizers had been influenced by the English dialects spoken by the colonizers' ancestors in Scotland and had acquired their emphasis on the \"r\" sound from those ancestors' dialects—not the other way around. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that the emphasis on the \"r\" sound is part of English dialects spoken in the Upland South today, which almost certainly wouldn't be the case if people from Scotland, who were the main colonizers of the Upland South, had eliminated that linguistic feature from their dialects.",

The volume, V, of a right circular cylinder is given by the formula \\(V = \\pi r^2h\\), where \\(r\\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \\(h\\) is the height of the cylinder. It's given that a right circular cylinder has a height of 6 centimeters. Therefore, \\(h = 6\\). It's also given that the cylinder has a base diameter of 22 centimeters. The radius of a circle is half the diameter of the circle. Since the base of a right circular cylinder is a circle, it follows that the radius of the base of the right circular cylinder is \\(\\frac{22}{2}\\), or 11, centimeters. Therefore, \\(r = 11\\). Substituting 11 for \\(r\\) and 6 for \\(h\\) in the formula \\(V = \\pi r^2h\\) yields \\(V = \\pi(11)^2(6)\\), which is equivalent to \\(V = \\pi(121)(6)\\), or \\(V = 726\\pi\\).

      "explanation": "Choice A is correct. A trigonometric ratio can be found using the unit circle, that is, a circle with radius 1 unit. If a central angle of a unit circle in the xy-plane centered at the origin has its starting side on the positive x-axis and its terminal side intersects the circle at a point (x, y), then the value of the tangent of the central angle is equal to the y-coordinate divided by the x-coordinate. There are \\(2\\pi\\) radians in a circle. Dividing \\(\\frac{92\\pi}{3}\\) by \\(2\\pi\\) yields \\(\\frac{92}{6}\\), which is equivalent to \\(15 + \\frac{2}{3}\\). It follows that on the unit circle centered at the origin in the xy-plane, the angle \\(\\frac{92\\pi}{3}\\) is the result of 15 revolutions from its starting side on the positive x-axis followed by a rotation through \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) radians. Therefore, the angles \\(\\frac{92\\pi}{3}\\) and \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) are coterminal angles and \\(\\tan(\\frac{92\\pi}{3})\\) is equal to \\(\\tan(\\frac{2\\pi}{3})\\). Since \\(\\frac{2\\pi}{3}\\) is greater than \\(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\) and less than \\(\\pi\\), it follows that the terminal side of the angle is in quadrant II and forms an angle of \\(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\), or 60°, with the negative x-axis. Therefore, the terminal side of the angle intersects the unit circle at the point \\((-\\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})\\).

It follows that when the value of \\(x\\) is either 7 or -3, the value of \\(f(x)\\) is 0. It's also given that the function \\(f\\) is defined by \\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\), where a, b, and c are constants. It follows that the function \\(f\\) is a quadratic function and, therefore, may be written in factored form as \\(f(x) = a(x - u)(x - v)\\), where the value of \\(f(x)\\) is 0 when \\(x\\) is either u or v. Since the value of \\(f(x)\\) is 0 when the value of \\(x\\) is either 7 or -3, and the value of \\(f(x)\\) is 0 when the value of \\(x\\) is either u or v, it follows that u and v are equal to 7 and -3. Substituting 7 for u and -3 for v in the equation \\(f(x) = a(x - u)(x - v)\\) yields \\(f(x) = a(x - 7)(x - (-3))\\), or \\(f(x) = a(x - 7)(x + 3)\\). Distributing the right-hand side of this equation yields \\(f(x) = a(x^2 - 7x + 3x - 21)\\), or \\(f(x) = ax^2 - 4ax - 21a\\). Since it's given that \\(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\\), it follows that \\(b = -4a\\). Adding a to each side of this equation yields \\(a + b = -3a\\). Since \\(a + b = -3a\\), if a is an integer, the value of \\(a + b\\) must be a multiple of 3. If a is an integer greater than 1, it follows that \\(a \\ge 2\\). Therefore, \\(-3a \\le -3(2)\\).

      "options": [],

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 25. The value of \\(g(7 - w)\\) is the value of \\(g(x)\\) when \\(x = 7 - w\\), where w is a constant. Substituting \\(7 - w\\) for \\(x\\) in the given equation yields \\(g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(7 - w - 2)(7 - w + 6)^2\\), which is equivalent to \\(g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2\\). It's given that the value of \\(g(7 - w)\\) is 0. Substituting 0 for \\(g(7 - w)\\) in the equation \\(g(7 - w) = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2\\) yields \\(0 = (7 - w)(5 - w)(13 - w)^2\\). Since the product of the three factors on the right-hand side of this equation is equal to 0, at least one of these three factors must be equal to 0. Therefore, the possible values of w can be found by setting each factor equal to 0. Setting the first factor equal to 0 yields \\(7 - w = 0\\). Adding w to both sides of this equation yields \\(7 = w\\). Therefore, 7 is one possible value of w. Setting the second factor equal to 0 yields \\(5 - w = 0\\). Adding w to both sides of this equation yields \\(5 = w\\). Therefore, 5 is a second possible value of w. Setting the third factor equal to 0 yields \\((13 - w)^2 = 0\\). Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields \\(13 - w = 0\\). Adding w to both sides of this equation yields \\(13 = w\\). Therefore, 13 is a third possible value of w. Adding the three possible values of w yields \\(7 + 5 + 13\\), or 25. Therefore, the sum of all possible values of w is 25.",

Dividing both sides of this inequality by -1 yields \\(y<-3\\). Therefore, when \\(x=440\\), the corresponding value of \\(y\\) must be less than -3. Substituting 441 for \\(x\\) in the given inequality yields \\(2(441)-y>883\\), or \\(882-y> 883\\). Subtracting 882 from both sides of this inequality yields \\(-y> 1\\).

Therefore, the length of the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of a rectangle forms a right triangle with the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle, where the shortest side and the longest side of the rectangle are the legs of the triangle and the diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the triangle. Let \\(s\\) represent the length, in units, of the shortest side of the rectangle. Since it's given that the diagonal is twice the length of the shortest side, \\(2s\\) represents the length, in units, of the diagonal of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, if a right triangle has a hypotenuse with length \\(c\\) and legs with lengths \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), then \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Substituting \\(s\\) for \\(a\\) and \\(2s\\) for \\(c\\) in this equation yields \\(s^2+b^2=(2s)^2\\), or \\(s^2 + b^2 = 4s^2\\). Subtracting \\(s^2\\) from both sides of this equation yields \\(b^2 = 3s^2\\). Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields \\(b=s\\sqrt{3}\\).

The lengths, in units, of the shortest and longest sides of the rectangle are represented by \\(s\\) and \\(s\\sqrt{3}\\), and it's given that the area of the rectangle is \\(1,089\\sqrt{3}\\) square units.

Taking the positive square root of both sides of this equation yields \\(33 = s\\). Since the length, in units, of the diagonal is represented by \\(2s\\), it follows that the length, in units, of the diagonal is \\(2(33)\\), or 66.

Substituting (–1, 1) for (a, b) and (5, –4) for (c, d) in the expression \\(\\frac{d-b}{c-a}\\) yields \\(\\frac{-4-1}{5-(-1)}\\), or \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\). Thus, the slope of this radius is \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\). A line that's tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius of the circle at the point of tangency. It follows that line t is perpendicular to the radius at the point (5, –4), so the slope of line t is the negative reciprocal of the slope of this radius. The negative reciprocal of \\(-\\frac{5}{6}\\) is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\). Therefore, the slope of line t is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\). Since the slope of line t is the same between any two points on line t, a point lies on line t if the slope of the line segment connecting the point and (5, –4) is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\). Substituting choice C, (10, 2), for (a, b) and (5, –4) for (c, d) in the expression \\(\\frac{d-b}{c-a}\\) yields \\(\\frac{-4-2}{5-10}\\), or \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\). Therefore, the point (10, 2) lies on line t.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. The slope of the line segment connecting \\((0, \\frac{6}{25})\\) and \\((5, –4)\\) is \\(\\frac{-4-\\frac{6}{25}}{5-0}\\), or \\(-\\frac{106}{125}\\), not \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\). Choice B is incorrect. The slope of the line segment connecting (4, 7) and (5, –4) is \\(\\frac{-4-7}{5-4}\\), or –11, not \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\). Choice D is incorrect. The slope of the line segment connecting (11, 1) and (5, –4) is \\(\\frac{-4-1}{5-11}\\), or \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\), not \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\).",
