      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the writing system created by Sequoyah. In this context, \"widespread\" means widely accepted or practiced. The text indicates that because Sequoyah's script accurately represented the spoken sounds of the Cherokee language and was easy to learn, nearly all Cherokee people were able to read and write it soon after it was created. This context demonstrates that the script was widely used by the Cherokee people. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"careful\" would mean exercised with care and attentive concern. Although the work of creating a writing system likely involved great care, the text indicates that the system was \"easy to learn,\" which conflicts with the idea that using this system requires a noteworthy amount of care. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"unintended\" means not deliberate. The idea that using Sequoyah's script was unintentional conflicts directly with the claim that it was easy to learn and used by \"over 90% of the Cherokee people\" by 1830. In fact, because one had to learn this system, it's not clear how one could use it unintentionally. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"infrequent\" means rare or not occurring often, which conflicts directly with the claim that \"over 90% of the Cherokee people\" were using Sequoyah's script by 1830.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Nuttall's 1886 research paper. In this context, \"acknowledged\" means recognized as having a certain status. The text indicates that other researchers recognized Nuttall's work as groundbreaking because of its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures. In other words, the researchers recognized the groundbreaking status of Nuttall's work. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"ensured\" would mean to have guaranteed or made sure something was the case. The text states that other researchers gave Nuttall's work recognition after it was published, but there's no indication that they contributed to the work or had any involvement that would have allowed them to make sure the work would be groundbreaking. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that other researchers \"denied,\" or refused to admit or accept, that Nuttall's work was groundbreaking; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that other researchers \"underestimated,\" or undervalued, Nuttall's work; on the contrary, it indicates that researchers praised the work, recognizing it as groundbreaking due to its \"convincing demonstration\" related to the age of the ancient sculptures.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of self-government among the Muscogee (Creek) Nation. In this context, \"implement\" means to carry out or put into effect. The text states that the National Council generates laws, while the principal chief and cabinet officials are responsible for \"devising policies and administering services in accordance with\" those laws. This context suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials implement the laws: they put the laws into effect by creating policies and administering services that accord with those laws. Choice B is incorrect because \"presume\" in this context would mean to assume based on incomplete information, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials either made assumptions about the content of the laws or had incomplete information about them. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"improvise\" would mean to create something without preparation, and the text does not suggest that the principal chief and cabinet officials create policies and administer services without advance preparation. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that the principal chief and cabinet officials \"mimic,\" or imitate, the laws generated by the National Council. To mimic laws would mean to generate new laws that are imitations of existing laws, but the text indicates that the National Council, not the principal chief and cabinet officials, is responsible for generating laws. Instead of generating laws, the principal chief and cabinet officials put laws into effect by \"devising policies and administering services in accordance with\" the laws.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the Three Sisters intercropping system. As used in this context, \"intricate\" would mean made up of complexly related elements. The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a \"web of relations\" in which the crops interact in various ways. The text's description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this \"web of relations\" is intricate. Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \"indecipherable,\" or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text's description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benefits that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not \"ornamental,\" or mainly serving a decorative purpose. Choice C is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \"obscure,\" or unknown or poorly understood, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text's description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not obscure.",

      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of bronze- and brass-casting techniques used by the Igun Eronmwon guild. In this context \"adhere to\" would mean to act in accordance with. The text states that although members of the Igun Eronmwon guild typically do something with techniques that have been passed down since the thirteenth century, they \"don't strictly observe every tradition.\" By establishing a contrast with not always following traditions, the context suggests that guild members do typically adhere to traditional techniques. Choice A is incorrect because in this context \"experiment with\" would mean to do something new with. Although using motors rather than manual bellows is presented as a new approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members \"don't strictly observe every tradition.\" The phrase \"experiment with\" wouldn't support the contrast because regularly trying new things with the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"improve on\" would mean to make better. Although using motors rather than manual bellows might be an improved approach, the text establishes a contrast between what the guild members typically do with techniques that have been passed down over centuries and the idea that the members \"don't strictly observe every tradition.\" The phrase \"improve on\" wouldn't support the contrast because regularly making changes to the techniques would be an example of not strictly following all traditions. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"grapple with\" would mean to try hard to solve a difficult problem.

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century household food purchases. In this context, \"surmised\" means formed an idea or assumption with little evidence. The text explains that certain economic historians \"assumed\" that large and small households spent different amounts on food per person, but that another economist found this supposition to be false based on evidence from available data. This context suggests that the economic historians made an incorrect assumption without enough consideration of evidence. Choice B is incorrect. In this context, \"contrived\" would mean brought about or created through trickery. Nothing in the text suggests that the economic historians were deliberately trying to trick people with a claim about food purchasing behaviors in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households; the text simply suggests that they made an assumption about those behaviors that another historian believes isn't supported by the available data. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that it's Logan and not the economic historians who \"questioned,\" or doubted, the assumption that large and small households in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries spent different amounts on food per person; the economic historians are the ones who made that assumption to begin with. Choice D is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that some economic historians \"regretted,\" or felt sad or remorseful about, the food purchasing behaviors of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century households. The text focuses on the idea that the economic historians made an assumption about those behaviors that may not be supported by available data, not on the historians' emotional response to what households did in the past.",

The text indicates that a tension exists among the styles that have influenced Cannon's work and goes on to describe how those styles differ: classic European portraiture favors realism, American pop art uses vivid colors, and intertribal flatstyle rejects the use of shading and perspective to achieve depth. This context suggests that the styles that have influenced Cannon's work are disparate. Choice A is incorrect because the text indicates that there is a tension among the influences on Cannon's artwork, so it wouldn't make sense to say that the influences are \"complementary,\" or that they complete one another or make up for one another's deficiencies.

In this context, \"paucity of\" means lack of. In describing the inspiration behind Al-Sweedan and Alhaj's research, the text uses the word \"though\" to suggest a contrasting relationship between two types of studies: those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living at a high altitude and those examining the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level. This contrasting relationship and the text's use of the word \"many\" provide context suggesting that there are few, if any, examples of the second type of study, whereas there are numerous examples of the first type. Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context for there to be a \"quarrel about,\" or open disagreement about, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level.

There's nothing in the text to suggest that the contrast between the two types of studies involves the extent to which researchers broadly agree or disagree about the contents of either type. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context for there to be a \"profusion of,\" or great abundance of, studies of the effect on blood chemistry of living in locations below sea level.

The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks \"stately and calm,\" the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was \"wide open to the long-expected guest,\" which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne's anticipation and Martha's activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest's arrival. The text indicates that the guest was \"long-expected,\" but characterizing Miss Pyne as \"stately and calm\" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and flowers and birds singing).",

Finally, the third sentence indicates that researcher Sarafina El-Badry Nance and colleagues investigated a possible method of obtaining the necessary information about Betelgeuse's internal characteristics, though they found that the method wouldn't be sufficient. Thus, the function of the second sentence is to identify the problem that Nance and colleagues attempted to solve but didn't.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the second sentence doesn't indicate how other astronomers or astrophysicists responded to the work done by Nance and colleagues; the text doesn't address this information at all. Choice B is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not the central finding they ultimately reported. It's the third sentence that presents Nance and colleagues' conclusion that a potential method for determining internal stellar states would be insufficient. Choice D is incorrect because the second sentence introduces the general problem Nance and colleagues hoped to solve, not a serious limitation of how they tried to solve it.

If Mexican American folklore collected in the twentieth century mostly consists of ballads about history and social life that originated recently, then that would support Paredes's argument by suggesting that the folklore mostly arose after Spanish rule ended in the early nineteenth century and that the folklore reflects cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than traditions from Spain.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the inclusion of songs influenced by sixteenth-century Spanish poetry among Mexican American folklore collected in the twentieth century would not support Paredes's view that the folklore was the result of cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States rather than an offshoot of Spanish folklore. If anything, the presence of such songs among the folklore collected in the twentieth century would weaken Paredes's argument, since it would reflect the influence of Spanish culture on the folklore. Choice B is incorrect because the mere presence of similarities in Mexican American folklore across regions would not be sufficient to draw a conclusion about where the folklore originated, let alone to support Paredes's argument that the folklore reflects various cultural interactions in Mexico and the United States. In fact, Paredes would likely expect there to be regional variations in folklore as different cultures have interacted in different places.

One explanation for these facts might be that the farmers developed techniques on their own that already had been invented centuries earlier by the Haudenosaunee people, but the text explicitly bars, or rules out, this explanation. If Euro-American farmers didn't learn these techniques from direct observation of Haudenosaunee practices and didn't invent the techniques independently, then the most logical explanation is that they learned the techniques from other people who were more directly influenced by Haudenosaunee practices than the farmers themselves were. Once they learned about Haudenosaunee agricultural practices, Euro-American farmers could then apply those practices to their own farming.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the fact that some Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States were using Haudenosaunee techniques suggests that the techniques were likely useful for the crops the farmers raised, not that the crops typically cultivated by the farmers were not well suited to Haudenosaunee farming techniques. If the farmers' crops were ill suited to the techniques, it's unlikely that the farmers would have used those techniques. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates only that Haudenosaunee agricultural techniques were used by Euro-American farmers in the northeastern United States, not that these techniques were widely used outside this region. Choice D is incorrect because the text states that some Euro-American farmers were using Haudenosaunee farming techniques early in the nineteenth century. This suggests that some Euro-American farmers were beginning to recognize the benefits of these techniques near the start of the century, not that such farmers only began to recognize the benefits of the techniques much later.",

If it were true both that Kuulo Kataa was founded in the fourteenth century CE and that artifacts found in excavations of the settlement are from the thirteenth century CE, it would be reasonable to conclude that the artifacts weren't created in the Kuulo Kataa settlement. That would suggest, then, that the artifacts originated somewhere else and eventually reached the settlement through trading or as people migrated.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the existence of thirteenth-century CE artifacts recovered during excavations of a settlement founded in the fourteenth century CE isn't logically connected to artifacts from one century being more commonly recovered than artifacts from another century. Rather than suggesting anything about how frequently artifacts from different times are found, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement's founding suggests that those items arrived in Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on time periods and says nothing about which region the founders of Kuulo Kataa have been thought to come from; similarly, the text doesn't suggest anything about where the thirteenth-century CE artifacts originated other than not from Kuulo Kataa. Therefore, it isn't logical to conclude that the mere existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the Kuulo Kataa settlement suggests that the founders of the settlement came from a particular region other than one previously assumed. Choice D is incorrect because the existence of artifacts from the thirteenth century CE at a site dated to the fourteenth century CE doesn't imply that fourteenth-century objects were damaged during excavations. There's nothing in the text to suggest that any objects were damaged; rather, the existence of artifacts confirmed as predating the settlement's founding suggests that those items were brought to Kuulo Kataa during or after its establishment.",

The text indicates that \\textit{A. thaliana} plants show accelerated flowering at high temperatures. To investigate the mechanism for this accelerated flowering, biologists replaced the ELF3 protein in one group of \\textit{A. thaliana} plants with a similar protein found in another plant species that doesn't show accelerated flowering. The team then compared these modified plants to \\textit{A. thaliana} plants that retained their original ELF3 protein. The text states that the two samples of plants showed no difference in flowering at 22° Celsius, but at 27° Celsius the unaltered plants with ELF3 showed accelerated flowering while the plants without ELF3 didn't. If accelerated flowering at the higher temperature occurred in the \\textit{A. thaliana} plants with ELF3 but not in the plants without the protein, then ELF3 likely enables \\textit{A. thaliana} to respond to increased temperatures. Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't mention whether any plants other than \\textit{A. thaliana} and stiff brome show temperature-sensitive flowering, so there is no support for the idea that this type of flowering is unique to \\textit{A. thaliana}. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the effects of ELF3 and not the production of it. There's nothing in the text to suggest that the amount of ELF3 in \\textit{A. thaliana} varies with temperature. Choice D is incorrect. While the text states that there was no difference in the flowering of modified and unmodified \\textit{A. thaliana} plants at 22° Celsius, there's no suggestion that \\textit{A. thaliana} only begins to flower at 22° Celsius; the text doesn't mention a specific temperature threshold required for \\textit{A. thaliana} flowering.",

In this context, \"healthy\" would mean not distressed or diseased. The text states that insect damage may cause viburnum plants to be discolored and have abnormal growths. In the next sentence, the phrase \"on the other hand\" indicates a contrast with the description of plants suffering from damage. Thus, the context contrasts the appearance of healthy, undamaged plants with the appearance of damaged plants. Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"struggling\" would mean working against difficulties. The text first describes viburnum plants experiencing damage by insects, and the phrase \"on the other hand\" then establishes a contrast with that description. It wouldn't make sense to contrast struggling viburnum plants with those being damaged by insects, because in both cases the plants would be experiencing difficulties.

The text explains that Blind Spot consists of original photographs as well as poetic prose-two elements that correspond to Cole's passions, identified in the text, for photography and the written word. This context suggests that Cole's excitement about photography and writing led him to create a book that successfully combines the two mediums.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because describing Cole as feeling \"indifference to\" his two passions wouldn't make sense in context. If Cole is indifferent to his passions, that would mean he doesn't care about photography or writing-in which case they wouldn't be his passions at all. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels \"concern about,\" or uneasiness about, his passions. The text's use of the word \"culminates\" indicates that Blind Spot represents a triumphant climax of Cole's passions, not a work that results from his sense of discomfort with photography and writing. Choice D is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that Cole feels \"surprise at,\" or astonished by, his passions. The text indicates that Cole's feeling about his passions \"culminates\" in a book that \"evocatively\" combines photographs and writing, suggesting that Cole has a long-standing and skillful relationship to his passions, not that he is startled by them.",

The text suggests that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin's willingness to go against expectations and not use plots and themes that seem to follow a formula reflects how she treats the standard practices of the genre. This context conveys that Jemisin chooses not to act in accordance with those conventions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In this context, \"question\" would mean doubt or object to. The text indicates that Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes in her science fiction writing, suggesting that she may actually object to those conventions of the genre, not that she chooses not to question them. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes. Rather than suggesting that Jemisin chooses not to \"react to,\" or act in response to, the standard practices of the genre, this context suggests that she is acting in response to such conventions by deliberately avoiding them. Choice C is incorrect. In this context, \"perceive\" would mean become aware of or understand. The text indicates that in her science fiction writing, Jemisin is willing to go against expectations and not use formulaic plots and themes.

In this context, to say that Pico portrays his \"ambivalence toward\" nature would mean that he portrays his mixed feelings about nature. The text explains that Pico \"honors the centrality of nature\" and also makes it clear that he doesn't enjoy being in nature. This context suggests that Pico feels ambivalence toward nature.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because saying that Pico portrays his \"responsiveness to\" nature would mean that he portrays himself as quick to react to nature, which isn't supported by the text. Instead, the text focuses on Pico's mixed feelings toward nature, describing him as both honoring nature's role in his tribe's beliefs and expressing his personal dislike for being in nature.

Then, Tom promises that the play they chose is modest and appropriate, and he further reasons that using the well-written prose of \"some respectable author\" is better than using their own words.

Although Tom mentions that using the words of a \"respectable author\" will be better than using their own words, he never addresses the idea that the people around him generally aren't skilled enough to stage a play.

Text 2 introduces Putirka and Xu, who indicate that sodium and lithium are present in several different minerals and that some of those minerals might exist in types of rock that are not found on Earth.

Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn't suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team confirmed that this relationship is closer than scientists had previously thought.

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents a finding that, if true, would support the scholar's claim about Toni Morrison's likely goal of strengthening the presence of Black writers on Random House's list of published authors. The text explains that Morrison was the first Black woman to be an editor for Random House and that she was an editor there from 1967 to 1983. If it were true that Random House published a higher percentage of works by Black authors throughout the 1970s-during most of Morrison's time working there-than it had previously published, that would suggest that Morrison may have made a deliberate effort to strengthen the presence of Black authors on the list of Random House's published authors, thus supporting the scholar's claim.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the scholar's claim is about Morrison's work as an editor at a publishing company and her likely effort to strengthen the presence of Black writers on that company's list of published authors. It might be true that Black authors interviewed in the 1980s and 1990s often cited Morrison's novels as an influence on their work, but that finding would simply suggest something about how those authors approached their work; it wouldn't show that Morrison intended to increase the number of Black writers among the published authors specifically at Random House. Choice C is incorrect because the scholar's claim is about Morrison's work as an editor at a publishing company, not about her work as a novelist. Therefore, a finding that Morrison's novels published after 1983 sold more copies and were more widely acclaimed than her earlier novels would have no bearing on the claim that as an editor Morrison made an effort to ensure that more Black writers were present on Random House's list of published authors. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text discusses Morrison's work as an editor at Random House, the scholar's claim focuses on Morrison's likely effort in that role to increase the number of Black writers present on Random House's list of published authors, not on the influence she may have had on the content of the works she edited. Without knowing whether Morrison's stylistic influence led to more publications or if Morrison applied her influence specifically to works by Black writers, the finding that works edited by Morrison could be identified by stylistic characteristics would have no bearing on the claim that Morrison intended to strengthen the presence of Black writers among the published authors at Random House.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them-that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000-63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000-235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000-34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn't show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson's study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can't show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don't support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

The text explains that Neanderthals used clamshells to make tools and that the sturdiest, and therefore the most desirable, shells for this purpose are found on the seafloor, not on the beach. However, the researchers also concluded that the clamshell tools made from shells from the seafloor are rarer than those made from shells from the beach. Meanwhile the table shows that at each depth, the number of tools made from shells from the beach exceeds the number made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. The fact that the more desirable shells are less common suggests that it was significantly more difficult to harvest shells from the seafloor than from the beach.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because knowing which depth represents the period of time with the highest Neanderthal population does not help answer the question of why the Neanderthals consistently made more tools from the less desirable shells from the beach than they made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor. Choice C is incorrect because it claims that the beach shells are more durable than the seafloor shells, which contradicts the text's description of shells from the seafloor as smoother and sturdier than shells from the beach. Choice D is incorrect because knowing which depth has the most artifacts or whether the clam population fluctuated does not help explain why tools made from the less desirable shells from the beach outnumber tools made from the more desirable shells from the seafloor.",

According to the text, the researcher hypothesized that Arctic ground squirrels would exhibit longer torpor bouts and shorter arousal episodes than Alaska marmots do—or, put the other way, that the marmots would show shorter torpor bouts and longer arousal episodes than the ground squirrels do. The table shows data about torpor bouts and arousal episodes for the two species from 2008 to 2011. According to the table, the average duration of torpor bouts was 13.81 days for Alaska marmots, shorter than the average of 16.77 days for Arctic ground squirrels, and the average duration of arousal episodes was 21.2 hours for Alaska marmots, longer than the average of 14.2 hours for Arctic ground squirrels. Thus, the table supports the researcher's hypothesis by showing that Alaska marmots had shorter bouts of torpor and longer arousal episodes than Arctic ground squirrels did.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table and doesn't support the researcher's hypothesis. The table shows that the average duration of arousal episodes was less than a day for both Alaska marmots (21.2 hours) and Arctic ground squirrels (14.2 hours). Additionally, information about arousal episodes for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels isn't sufficient to support a hypothesis involving comparisons of both arousal episodes and torpor bouts for those animals. Choice B is incorrect because it doesn't support the researcher's hypothesis, which involves comparisons of arousal episodes as well as torpor bouts for Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels. Noting that both animals had torpor bouts lasting several days, on average, doesn't address arousal episodes at all, nor does it reveal how the animals' torpor bouts compared. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't support the researcher's hypothesis. Although the table does show that Alaska marmots had more torpor bouts (12) than arousal episodes (11) and that their arousal episodes were much shorter than their torpor bouts (21.2 hours and 13.81 days, respectively), comparing data across only Alaska marmot behaviors isn't sufficient to support a hypothesis about torpor and arousal behaviors of both Alaska marmots and Arctic ground squirrels.",

The text indicates that the sweet potato is found in Polynesia but originated in South America, and that the sweet potato was being cultivated by Native Hawaiians and other Indigenous peoples in Polynesia long before sea voyages between South America and Polynesia began. The text goes on to note that research by Muñoz-Rodríguez and colleagues has established that the Polynesian varieties of sweet potato split from South American varieties more than 100,000 years ago, which is thousands of years before humans settled in Polynesia.

Though the atoms' movement is a recurring action and \"will reach\" can also be used to indicate a habitual or recurring action, it creates a logical inconsistency in this sentence when paired with the present tense verbs \"travel\" and \"are diverted.\" Choice C is incorrect because the past perfect tense verb \"had reached\" is inconsistent with the present tense verbs used to describe how atoms move through the synchrotron. Choice D is incorrect because the present progressive tense verb \"are reaching\" is inconsistent with the present tense verbs used to describe how atoms move through the synchrotron. While both verbs occur in the present, the present progressive tense suggests that the action is currently in progress. This creates a logical inconsistency when paired with the present tense verbs \"travel\" and \"are diverted,\" which offer a general description of the tendencies of the atoms' movement, rather than a description of an action that is currently in progress.",

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Let x be the first integer and let y be the second integer. If the first integer is 11 greater than twice the second integer, then \\(x = 2y+11\\). If the product of the two integers is 546, then \\(xy = 546\\). Substituting \\(2y+11\\) for x in this equation results in \\((2y+11)y=546\\). Distributing the y to both terms in the parentheses results in \\(2y^2 +11y=546\\). Subtracting 546 from both sides of this equation results in \\(2y^2 +11y-546=0\\). The left-hand side of this equation can be factored by finding two values whose product is \\(2(-546)\\), or -1,092, and whose sum is 11. The two values whose product is -1,092 and whose sum is 11 are 39 and -28. Thus, the equation \\(2y^2 +11y-546=0\\) can be rewritten as \\(2y^2 +28y-39y-546 = 0\\), which is equivalent to \\(2y(y−14)+39(y-14)=0\\), or \\((2y+39)(y−14)=0\\). By the zero product property, it follows that \\(2y+39=0\\) and \\(y-14=0\\). Subtracting 39 from both sides of the equation \\(2y+39=0\\) yields \\(2y = -39\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields \\(y = -\\frac{39}{2}\\). Since y is a positive integer, the value of y is not \\(–\\frac{39}{2}\\). Adding 14 to both sides of the equation \\(y-14=0\\) yields \\(y = 14\\). Substituting 14 for y in the equation \\(xy=546\\) yields \\(x(14)=546\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 14 results in \\(x = 39\\). Therefore, the two integers are 14 and 39, so the smaller of the two integers is 14.\nChoice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice C is incorrect.

Therefore, the proportion of voters from the poll who responded they would vote for Angel Cruz is \\(\\frac{483}{803}\\). It's also given that there are a total of 6,424 voters in the election. Therefore, the total number of people who would be expected to vote for Angel Cruz is \\(6,424(\\frac{483}{803})\\) or 3,864. Since 3,864 of the 6,424 total voters would be expected to vote for Angel Cruz, it follows that 6,424-3,864, or 2,560 voters would be expected not to vote for Angel Cruz. The difference in the number of votes for and against Angel Cruz is 3,864-2,560, or 1,304 votes. Therefore, if 6,424 people vote in the election, Angel Cruz would be expected to win by 1,304 votes.\nChoice A is incorrect.

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 10. It's given that the graph of \\(x^2 + x + y^2 + y = \\frac{199}{2}\\) in the xy-plane is a circle. The equation of a circle in the xy-plane can be written in the form \\((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2\\), where the coordinates of the center of the circle are \\((h,k)\\) and the length of the radius of the circle is r. The term \\((x-h)^2\\) in this equation can be obtained by adding the square of half the coefficient of x to both sides of the given equation to complete the square. The coefficient of x is 1. Half the coefficient of x is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). The square of half the coefficient of x is \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\). Adding \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) to each side of \\((x^2+x)+(y^2+y) = \\frac{199}{2}\\) yields \\((x^2+x+\\frac{1}{4})+(y^2+y) = \\frac{199}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\), or \\((x+\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y^2+y) = \\frac{199}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}\\). Similarly, the term \\((y-k)^2\\) can be obtained by adding the square of half the coefficient of y to both sides of this equation, which yields \\((x+\\frac{1}{2})^2 + (y^2+y+\\frac{1}{4}) = \\frac{199}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\), or \\((x+\\frac{1}{2})^2+(y+\\frac{1}{2})^2 = \\frac{199}{2}+\\frac{1}{4}+\\frac{1}{4}\\).

      "correct_answer": "59/9",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is \\( \\frac{59}{9} \\). When the graph of an equation in the form \\( Ax + By = C \\), where A, B, and C are constants, is translated down k units in the xy-plane, the resulting graph can be represented by the equation \\( Ax+B(y+k)=C \\). It's given that the graph of \\( 9x-10y =19 \\) is translated down 4 units in the xy-plane. Therefore, the resulting graph can be represented by the equation \\( 9x-10(y+4)=19 \\), or \\( 9x-10y-40=19 \\). Adding 40 to both sides of this equation yields \\( 9x-10y=59 \\). The x-coordinate of the x-intercept of the graph of an equation in the xy-plane is the value of x in the equation when \\( y = 0 \\). Substituting 0 for y in the equation \\( 9x−10y=59 \\) yields \\( 9x-10(0)=59 \\), or \\( 9x = 59 \\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 9 yields \\( x = \\frac{59}{9} \\).

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. Since the value of y increases by a constant factor, 4, for each increase of 1 in the value of x, the relationship between x and y is exponential. An exponential relationship between x and y can be represented by an equation of the form \\( y = a(b)^x \\), where a is the value of y when \\( x=0 \\) and y increases by a factor of b for each increase of 1 in the value of x. Since \\( y=200 \\) when \\( x = 0 \\), \\( a=200 \\). Since y increases by a factor of 4 for each increase of 1 in the value of x, \\( b = 4 \\).

To complete the square, adding 1 to each side of this equation yields \\(x^2 - 2x + 1 = 9 + 1\\), or \\((x-1)^2 = 10\\). Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields \\(x - 1 = \\pm\\sqrt{10}\\). Adding 1 to each side of this equation yields \\(x = 1 \\pm\\sqrt{10}\\).

Since the distribution of the values of both data set A and data set B form symmetric dot plots, and each data set has an odd number of values, it follows that the median is given by the middle value in each of the dot plots. Thus, the median of data set A is 13, and the median of data set B is 13. Therefore, statement I is true. Data set A and data set B have the same frequency for each of the values 11, 12, 14, and 15. Data set A has a frequency of 1 for values 10 and 16, whereas data set B has a frequency of 2 for values 10 and 16. Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a data set; it is larger when there are more values further from the mean, and smaller when there are more values closer to the mean. Since both distributions are symmetric with an odd number of values, the mean of each data set is equal to its median. Thus, each data set has a mean of 13. Since more of the values in data set A are closer to 13 than data set B, it follows that data set A has a smaller standard deviation than data set B. Thus, statement II is false. Therefore, only statement I must be true.\n\nChoice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice C is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.\nChoice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. It's given that the right triangle is isosceles. In an isosceles right triangle, the two legs have equal lengths, and the length of the hypotenuse is \\(\\sqrt{2}\\) times the length of one of the legs. Let \\(l\\) represent the length, in inches, of each leg of the isosceles right triangle. It follows that the length of the hypotenuse is \\(l\\sqrt{2}\\) inches. The perimeter of a figure is the sum of the lengths of the sides of the figure. Therefore, the perimeter of the isosceles right triangle is \\(l+l+l\\sqrt{2}\\) inches. It's given that the perimeter of the triangle is \\(94+94\\sqrt{2}\\) inches. It follows that \\(l+l+l\\sqrt{2} = 94+94\\sqrt{2}\\). Factoring the left-hand side of this equation yields \\((1+1+\\sqrt{2})l=94+94\\sqrt{2}\\), or \\((2+\\sqrt{2})l=94+94\\sqrt{2}\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by \\(2+\\sqrt{2}\\) yields \\(l = \\frac{94+94\\sqrt{2}}{2+\\sqrt{2}}\\). Rationalizing the denominator of the right-hand side of this equation by multiplying the right-hand side of the equation by \\(\\frac{2-\\sqrt{2}}{2-\\sqrt{2}}\\) yields \\(l = \\frac{(94+94\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})}{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})}\\).

The first equation in the given system is \\(\\frac{3}{2}y - \\frac{1}{4}x = \\frac{2}{3} - \\frac{3}{2}y\\). Multiplying each side of this equation by 12 yields \\(18y-3x=8-18y\\).
