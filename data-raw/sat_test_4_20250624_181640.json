      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's contact with the asteroid 101955 Bennu. In this context, \"collected\" means acquired and took away. The text indicates that although the boulders on the asteroid's surface caused some unforeseen problems, OSIRIS-REx was able to gather a sample to return to Earth. This context suggests that OSIRIS-REx successfully collected a sample of 101955 Bennu.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context \"attached\" means connected or affixed. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth; it doesn't suggest that the spacecraft attached anything to the asteroid. Choice C is incorrect because in this context \"followed\" means tracked or traveled behind and the text discusses OSIRIS-REx's brief encounter with 101955 Bennu during which the spacecraft gathered a sample to bring to Earth. The text doesn't suggest that the spacecraft tracked the sample, and it's not clear what it would mean for the spacecraft to travel behind the sample it collected. Choice D is incorrect because in this context \"replaced\" means put back or returned. The text indicates that OSIRIS-REx gathered pieces of 101955 Bennu to bring to Earth but doesn't suggest that anything was returned to the asteroid.",

The text states that because the surface of the Moon was softer when the Moon was still forming than it is now, early asteroid and meteoroid impacts \"would have left less of an impression\" and, as a result, evidence of them may no longer exist. This context supports the idea that the surface of the Moon may not accurately show signs of early impact events.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately \"receive,\" or acquire or experience, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids. The text indicates that the impacts have already occurred, and it isn't clear how the Moon's surface could be accurate or inaccurate in experiencing them. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately \"evaluate,\" or determine the significance or condition of, early impacts from asteroids or meteoroids, since that would suggest that it's possible for the Moon's surface to make a decision of any kind. Choice D is incorrect. In this context, \"mimic\" would mean to deliberately simulate or closely imitate something. It wouldn't make sense to say that the surface of the Moon may not accurately mimic early asteroid and meteoroid impacts, since that would suggest that it's possible for the Moon to deliberately imitate something.",

As used in this context, \"recognizable\" means apparent or identifiable. The text indicates that handedness is \"easy to observe in humans,\" but that animal-behavior researchers use special tasks to determine handedness in other animals. This context and the use of \"less\" before the blank indicate that compared with handedness in humans, handedness in other animals is less recognizable.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less \"intriguing,\" or fascinating, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn't suggest that handedness is more fascinating in humans. Choice C is incorrect because there's nothing in the text to suggest that handedness is less \"significant,\" or important or meaningful, in nonhuman animals than it is in humans. The text focuses on how easy it is to observe handedness in humans as compared with other animals; the text doesn't suggest that handedness is more significant in humans. Choice D is incorrect because \"useful,\" or functional or helpful, wouldn't make sense in context.

In other words, the sentence indicates that Bosch's influence on Banisadr is significant, and thus recognizing that influence is by no means unimportant.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that recognizing Bosch's influence on Banisadr isn't \"substantial,\" or meaningful. The text states that Banisadr himself cites Bosch as an influence. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that it isn't \"satisfying,\" or pleasing, to recognize Bosch's influence on Banisadr.

A persuasive young fellow who claimed he was closing out his stock let the old man have it for what he called a song. It was only a little out-of-the-way store which subsisted chiefly on the framing of pictures. The old man looked around at his views of the city, his pictures of cats and dogs, his flaming bits of landscape. \"Don't belong in here,\" he fumed.\n\nAnd yet the old man was secretly proud of his acquisition.

The text begins by stating that the new picture \"failed to fit in\" with the other items that the shop owner has. The text goes on to illustrate that point by describing the other pictures the shop owner has, indicating that the shop owner is fuming because he doesn't think the new picture belongs in the store. In the second paragraph, however, the text indicates that the shop owner is \"secretly proud of his acquisition.\" The main purpose of the text is thus to reveal the shop owner's conflicted feelings about the new picture.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that the shop owner resents the young man who sold him the new picture; in fact, the text gives no indication of the owner's feelings about the young man at all. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that the new picture is different from the other items in the shop, there's no suggestion that the shop owner prizes either the new picture or the pictures of the city, pets, and landscapes more than he prizes any other items. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't describe what the new picture looks like; rather, the text identifies some of the other kinds of images that the shop owner has and states that they're different from the new picture without explaining how they're different.",

Thus, the text moves from the speaker's description of a distinctive sight in nature to her pondering about what meaning to attribute to that sight.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the speaker assesses a natural sight—a \"black cypress\" tree standing \"against a gold, gold sky\" like a pointed finger—but doesn't question the accuracy of her own assessment. Although she wonders why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it's pointing, the speaker doesn't suggest that her belief that the tree resembles a finger is wrong. Choice C is incorrect. Although the speaker describes seeing a \"black cypress\" tree standing \"against a gold, gold sky\" like a pointed finger, she wonders about that natural image (asking why the finger, which is really a tree, is black and why it's pointing) and doesn't give any indication that any people are present in the scene. Choice D is incorrect. Although the speaker examines and wonders about one thing in her surroundings—a \"black cypress\" tree standing \"against a gold, gold sky\" like a pointed finger—she doesn't address her own emotional state or consider how it's affected by her surroundings.",

This generalization is exemplified by the text's discussion of the relationship between mimosa trees and \\textit{B. terrenus} beetles. When mimosa trees were introduced to North America in 1785, no \\textit{B. terrenus} beetles were present, so the relationship between the trees and the beetles that exists in their native East Asia was disrupted.

According to the text, Chang and colleagues were simply monitoring mimosa trees when the beetles happened to be introduced to the area. Choice C is incorrect because the third sentence offers a generalization about the relationship between predators and prey, not an explanation for the findings of Chang and colleagues that differs from an explanation presented elsewhere in the text.

      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes the most likely way that Graeber and Wengrow (Text 2) would respond to the \"conventional wisdom\" presented in Text 1. According to Text 1, the conventional wisdom about human social systems is that they developed through stages, beginning with hunter-gatherer bands, then moving to clan associations, then chiefdoms, and finally arriving at states with bureaucratic structures. Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow believe that human social systems have been flexible, shifting between different types of structures, including both hierarchical and collective systems, and that these shifts may have even occurred seasonally. This suggests that Graeber and Wengrow would dispute the idea that developments in social structures have followed a linear progression through distinct stages.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because nothing in Text 2 suggests that Graeber and Wengrow believe that decentralized collective societies are more significant than hierarchical systems. Text 2 is focused on Graeber and Wengrow's view that humans have flexibly shifted among various social structures, not on the importance of particular structures relative to others. Choice C is incorrect because Text 2 doesn't include any information suggesting that Graeber and Wengrow believe that hierarchies didn't emerge until after the rise of agriculture. In fact, Text 2 indicates that Graeber and Wengrow cite evidence suggesting that some hunter-gatherer groups formed social structures with hierarchical elements (\"communities that included esteemed individuals\") 50,000 years ago, long before the rise of agriculture, which Text 1 says occurred around 12,000 years ago.",

The text indicates that although two subspecies of the birds live in the same region, the tail feathers of the migrating males make a higher-pitched sound than the tail feathers of the nonmigrating males do. Gómez-Bahamón and her team hypothesize that female fork-tailed flycatchers are attracted to the particular sound made by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will bring about additional \"genetic and anatomical divergence\" between the two subspecies. If it were found that the pitch generated by the tail feathers of migrating males is getting higher over successive generations, it would indicate that the shape of the migrating subspecies' tail feathers is diverging further from that of the nonmigrating subspecies. And if females continue to prefer the sounds of the males of their own subspecies, the females of the migrating subspecies will become acclimated to increasingly higher pitches over subsequent generations, causing further divergence between the subspecies. Thus, if it were found that migrating males' tail feathers were producing higher pitches over time, that would support the researchers' hypothesis.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the researchers' hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding is about the shape of wing feathers and how that affects long-distance flight, whereas the hypothesis is about the shape of tail feathers and how that relates to female mate preference. Choice C is incorrect because the researchers' hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. This finding focuses on how the tail feather sounds communicate different messages, which doesn't address differences between the subspecies or female preferences. Choice D is incorrect because the researchers' hypothesis is that female flycatchers prefer the sounds produced by the tail feathers of males of their own subspecies, which will lead to further divergence between the two subspecies. The finding that breeding habits haven't changed for either subspecies does not, by itself, suggest anything about female preferences or divergence between the two subspecies.",

The table shows the ablation rates for three elements—iron, potassium, and sodium—found in cosmic dust that comes from one of four sources. The text says that the ablation rate for a given element in slower-moving SPC or AST dust was lower than the ablation rate for that same element in faster-moving HTC or OCC dust. The text then presents the first part of an example of this pattern, describing an ablation rate of 28% for iron in AST dust. The information that iron from HTC dust had an ablation rate of 90% is therefore the most effective way to complete this example—the comparison of a relatively low ablation rate for iron in slower-moving AST dust with a relatively high ablation rate for iron in faster-moving HTC dust illustrates the tendency of ablation rates for a given element to be lower in slower-moving dust than in faster-moving dust.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that SPC dust, like AST dust, moves relatively slowly; a comparison of the ablation rates of iron from two slower-moving dust sources could not be an example of the difference between ablation rates in slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, which is the pattern that the example is supposed to illustrate. Choice B is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Choice D is incorrect because the example in the text is supposed to illustrate the difference in the ablation rates of the same element from slower-moving dust and faster-moving dust, and the first part of the example provides data about the ablation rate of iron, which means the second part of the example must also be about the ablation rate of iron, not the ablation rate of sodium. Additionally, any ablation rate from AST dust would be ineffective in this example since AST dust is referenced in the first part of the example and thus additional data focused on AST dust would not illustrate a variation across dust types.",

The student then grew several plants from each species both in soil containing mycorrhizal fungi and in soil that had been treated to kill mycorrhizal and other fungi. After several weeks, the student measured the plants' average mass and was surprised to discover that ______\n\nWhich choice most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement?",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most effectively uses data from the table to complete the statement. The text explains that mycorrhizal hosts are plants that benefit from the presence of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil and that some such plants produce more mass when grown in the presence of these fungi, while for nonmycorrhizal species the fungi either have no effect or may be harmful. The experiment included two mycorrhizal hosts (corn and marigold) and one nonmycorrhizal species (broccoli). Given the claim in the text that nonmycorrhizal species will see either no difference or a decrease in mass when exposed to mycorrhizal fungi, the student would likely have been surprised by the higher average mass for broccoli grown in the presence of the fungi than the broccoli grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the corn data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host corn is more massive in the presence of the fungi likely fits with what the student expected and would therefore not be surprising. Choice C is incorrect. Although this choice accurately describes the marigold data from the table, the fact that the mycorrhizal host marigold is more massive in the presence of the fungi is likely what the student expected and thus would not be surprising. Choice D is incorrect because it does not accurately represent the data in the table—when grown in soil treated to kill fungi, corn had an average mass of 3.8 g while broccoli had an average mass of 7g—and because making comparisons among the plants in the no-fungi condition, by itself, does not provide a basis to compare the average mass of mycorrhizal hosts and nonmycorrhizal species grown in the presence of the fungi with those grown in the soil treated to kill fungi.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it presents the conclusion that most logically completes the text's discussion about the significance of the cupid found at Pompeii. The text indicates that the cupid is near a statue of a female figure who is fishing, and it goes on to indicate that because Venus is associated with cupids, some scholars believe the female figure to be the goddess Venus. But the text then says that, according to archaeologist Carla Brain, cupids may have also been associated with the activity of fishing, which, if true, would suggest that the mere appearance of a cupid near a female figure engaged in fishing does not indicate with certainty that the figure is Venus (that is, the cupid might be associated with fishing, and the figure might be anyone at all).\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text says nothing about how often Venus was depicted fishing in Roman art: it only implies that in certain instances a female figure may or may not be Venus. Choice C is incorrect because Carla Brain's proposed explanation for the presence of the cupids makes no reference to the female figure, and so the possibility that the figure in the artworks is in fact Venus cannot be definitively eliminated. Choice D is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to suggest that the only reasonable way to interpret the figure is as Venus.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer. The convention being tested is the punctuation of a supplementary word or phrase between two main clauses. This choice correctly uses a comma to separate the supplementary adverb \"however\" from the preceding main clause (\"Okinaka doesn't...single-handedly\") and a semicolon to join the next main clause (\"all...culture\") to the rest of the sentence. Further, placing the semicolon after \"however\" correctly indicates that the information in the preceding main clause (Okinaka doesn't make such decisions single-handedly) is contrary to what might be assumed from the information in the previous sentence (Okinaka sits on the review board that adds new sites to the Hawaii Register of Historic Places).\n\nChoice B is incorrect because placing the semicolon after \"single-handedly\" and the comma after \"however\" illogically indicates that the information in the next main clause (all historical designations must be approved by a group of experts) is contrary to the information in the previous clause (Okinaka doesn't make such decisions single-handedly). Choice C is incorrect because it results in a comma splice. Commas can't be used in this way to punctuate a supplementary word or phrase between two main clauses. Choice D is incorrect because it results in a run-on sentence. The two main clauses are fused without punctuation and/or a conjunction.",

As used in this context, \"predicted\" means forecast, or indicated that something would happen in the future. The text indicates that the fashion resale market made a lot of money in 2019 and that some analysts expected the market to continue to grow. This context suggests that the analysts believed that the fashion resale market was going to make more money than it had already made, with the analysts indicating that revenues would more than double by 2028.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that some analysts \"produced,\" or manufactured or brought about, the increase in future revenues of the fashion resale market. The analysts themselves couldn't have brought about the future revenue growth, since, as the text suggests, they were merely in the position of drawing conclusions about future fashion resale market revenue based on 2019 revenue. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \"denied,\" or rejected, this notion. Nothing in the text supports the idea that these analysts thought the revenues wouldn't grow. Choice C is incorrect because the text indicates that some analysts expected the fashion resale market to continue to grow in the future, not that they \"worried,\" or felt concerned, that revenue would significantly increase by 2028. Nothing in the text suggests that the analysts felt concerned about the increase; rather, the text suggests that the increase would represent a favorable outcome, since it would mean that the fashion resale market grew to generate even more revenue.",

In this context, “overcome” means to succeed in dealing with an obstacle. The text suggests that although it's difficult to move biomolecules through plant cell walls, Landry and her colleagues have shown that carbon nanotubes may be useful, since they can cross cell walls. This context conveys that Landry and her colleagues think it's possible, using carbon nanotubes, to succeed in dealing with the obstacle of transmitting biomolecules to plant cells.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “conceptualize,” or form an idea of, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells. The text presents this difficulty as a known problem that Landry and her colleagues think they may have solved, not as a mysterious occurrence that they have yet to form ideas about. Choice B is incorrect because the text suggests that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to successfully deal with the problem of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells, not that Landry and her colleagues think it may be possible to “neglect,” or simply to disregard and ignore the problem. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to say that Landry and her colleagues have shown that it may be possible to “illustrate,” or demonstrate, the difficulty of transmitting biomolecules through the walls of plant cells by using carbon nanotubes. According to the text, carbon nanotubes allow molecules to be transmitted to plant cells—something that is otherwise difficult to do. The text therefore presents carbon nanotubes as a way of possibly solving a problem, not as a means of demonstrating the problem.",

Saying that a monarch who is faced with questions about the legitimacy of his reign was able to “reciprocate” his right to the French throne would mean that he either returned his right to the throne or that he responded in kind to the challenge. Neither of these meanings would make sense in context because the text focuses on people who did reign as French monarchs and defended their right to do so. Choice B is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “annotate,” or add notes to or explain, his right to the French throne. Nothing in the text suggests that the monarchs were writing notes about their right to the throne; instead, faced with questions about the legitimacy of their reign, the monarchs defended their right. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context to discuss factors that enabled a monarch to “disengage,” or withdraw his right to the French throne.

The first two sentences establish that birds of some species don't raise their own young; instead, they lay their eggs in the nests of birds of other species. The underlined sentence then states that female cuckoo birds engage in this behavior, having been observed specifically laying their eggs in other nests while the other birds are out finding food. According to the text, the cuckoo chicks are then raised by the other birds. Thus, the underlined sentence provides a particular detail about how female cuckoos carry out the behavior of laying eggs for other birds to raise.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. Rather than mentioning a physical feature of female cuckoos, the underlined sentence introduces a specific behavior of female cuckoos: laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away. The only reference to physical features is the last sentence's general mention of cuckoo chicks looking different from chicks of other species. Choice B is incorrect because the underlined sentence refers to the nests of birds other than cuckoos and doesn't describe how any nests look, cuckoo or otherwise. Instead, the sentence addresses how female cuckoos use other birds' nests. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined sentence describes only female cuckoo behavior (laying eggs in the nests of birds of other species when the other birds are away); it's the last sentence of the text that addresses the other birds' reaction, indicating that those birds usually raise the cuckoo chicks once they've hatched.",

According to the text, the student hypothesizes that Brassica rapa parachinensis (choy sum) will benefit more from acidic soil than it will from neutral soil. The text then explains that the student planted 16 choy sum seeds in potting soil with coffee grounds added to increase acidity and another 16 seeds in soil without coffee grounds as a control (a group identical to the experimental group except for the experimental modification being tested). If the hypothesis were correct, the plants in the more acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture would grow faster than those in the control group. However, choice A proposes a scenario in which the plants in soil without coffee grounds were “significantly taller” than those in the more acidic mixture—an outcome that weakens the hypothesis that higher acidity is beneficial to the plants' growth.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. If the choy sum planted in the neutral soil produced less plant matter and therefore weighed less than the choy sum planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen the student's hypothesis, not weaken it. Choice C is incorrect. If seeds planted in neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly later than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student's hypothesis that acidic soil benefits choy sum. Choice D is incorrect. If seeds planted in the neutral soil (without coffee grounds) sprouted significantly fewer plants than seeds planted in the acidic soil-and-coffee-grounds mixture did, this finding would strengthen, not weaken, the student's hypothesis that choy sum benefits from acidic soil.",

Referring to himself in the second person (with \"thy\"), the character exclaims \"Beat at this gate that let thy folly in / And thy dear judgement out!\" Lear refers metaphorically to his own mind as a gate that has allowed folly, or poor judgement, to enter and good judgement to escape. This suggests that Lear regrets his attempts to test his three daughters' devotion to him, regarding those attempts as examples of the folly that has entered the gate of his mind.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because this quotation doesn't express King Lear's sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his belief that the harm that others have done to him (or the extent to which they have \"sinned against\" him) outweighs whatever harm he himself has caused by \"sinning.\" Choice B is incorrect because this quotation doesn't express King Lear's sense of regret over his own actions; instead, it expresses his thoughts about an approaching storm (\"this tempest\"), which he believes \"will not give [him] leave to ponder,\" or time to consider, the harm that he will continue to experience (\"things\" that \"would hurt [him] more\").

Choice D is incorrect. The text doesn't consider the possibility that before their migration to the Rio Grande Valley after 1280, the Ancestral Puebloans of Mesa Verde might have adopted turkey farming from an outside Indigenous civilization in another region; instead, the text provides evidence suggesting that the Ancestral Puebloans brought turkey farming to another region— the Rio Grande Valley—after 1280.",

Because researchers aren't able to influence who wins elections, they're also unable to determine who would serve as an appropriately similar member of a control group. Thus, it logically follows that researchers will find it difficult to identify a group of people who can function as an appropriate control group for their studies.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on the struggle to put together a control group for experiments; it doesn't suggest that finding information about politicians' behavior is difficult. Choice B is incorrect because the experiments mentioned in the text are testing the effects of holding elected office on a person's behavior. Studying people who have already held elected office wouldn't provide an opportunity to note any behavioral changes that the position might cause. Choice C is incorrect because the text defines people in a control group as those \"who are otherwise similar to the office-holders\"; selecting people who differ from the office-holders wouldn't fit the criteria for an appropriate control group.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is correct. Since the triangle is an isosceles right triangle, the two sides that form the right angle must be the same length. Let \\(x\\) be the length, in inches, of each of those sides. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\), where \\(c\\) is the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the lengths of the other two sides. Substituting \\(x\\) for \\(a\\), \\(x\\) for \\(b\\), and 58 for \\(c\\) in this equation yields \\(x^2 + x^2 = 58^2\\), or \\(2x^2 = 58^2\\). Dividing each side of this equation by 2 yields \\(x^2 = \\frac{58^2}{2}\\). Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields two solutions: \\(x = \\frac{58}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) and \\(x = -\\frac{58}{\\sqrt{2}}\\). The value of \\(x\\) must be positive because it represents a side length. Therefore, \\(x = \\frac{58}{\\sqrt{2}}\\), or \\(x = 29\\sqrt{2}\\). The perimeter, in inches, of the triangle is \\(58+x+x\\), or \\(58+2x\\).

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The equation of a parabola in the xy-plane can be written in the form \\(y=a(x-h)^2 +k\\), where \\(a\\) is a constant and \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex of the parabola. If \\(a\\) is positive, the parabola will open upward, and if \\(a\\) is negative, the parabola will open downward. It's given that the parabola has vertex \\((9, -14)\\). Substituting 9 for \\(h\\) and −14 for \\(k\\) in the equation \\(y = a(x-h)^2 +k\\) gives \\(y=a(x-9)^2-14\\), which can be rewritten as \\(y=a(x-9)(x-9)-14\\), or \\(y=a(x^2-18x+81)-14\\). Distributing the factor of \\(a\\) on the right-hand side of this equation yields \\(y = ax^2 -18ax +81a-14\\). Therefore, the equation of the parabola, \\(y = ax^2 -18ax +81a-14\\), can be written in the form \\(y = ax^2 +bx+c\\), where \\(a=a\\), \\(b=-18a\\), and \\(c=81a-14\\). Substituting -18a for \\(b\\) and 81a-14 for \\(c\\) in the expression \\(a+b+c\\) yields \\((a)+(-18a)+(81a-14)\\), or \\(64a-14\\). Since the vertex of the parabola, \\((9, –14)\\), is below the x-axis, and it's given that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the parabola must open upward. Therefore, the constant \\(a\\) must have a positive value. Setting the expression \\(64a-14\\) equal to the value in choice D yields \\(64a-14=-12\\). Adding 14 to both sides of this equation yields \\(64a = 2\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 64 yields \\(a = \\frac{2}{64}\\), which is a positive value. Therefore, if the equation of the parabola is written in the form \\(y = ax^2 +bx+c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants, the value of \\(a+b+c\\) could be -12.\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

Choice B is incorrect. If the equation of a parabola with a vertex at \\((9, -14)\\) is written in the form \\(y = ax^2 + bx +c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants and \\(a+b+c=-19\\), then the value of \\(a\\) will be negative, which means the parabola will open downward, not upward, and will intersect the x-axis at zero points, not two points.

If the trailer has a weight of 500 pounds and each box weighs 120 pounds, the expression \\(500+120b\\), where b is the number of boxes, gives the combined weight of the trailer and the boxes. Since the combined weight must be no more than 4,600 pounds, the possible numbers of boxes the truck can tow are given by the inequality \\(500+120b \\leq 4,600\\). Subtracting 500 from both sides of this inequality yields \\(120b \\leq 4,100\\). Dividing both sides of this inequality by 120 yields \\(b\\leq\\frac{205}{6}\\), or b is less than or equal to approximately 34.17.

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Multiplying each side of the given equation by -16 yields \\(64x^2+112x=576\\). To complete the square, adding 49 to each side of this equation yields \\(64x^2 +112x+49=576+49\\), or \\((8x+7)^2 = 625\\). Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields two equations: \\(8x +7=25\\) and \\(8x+7=-25\\). Subtracting 7 from each side of the equation \\(8x+7=25\\) yields \\(8x = 18\\). Dividing each side of this equation by 8 yields \\(x= \\frac{18}{8}\\), or \\(x = \\frac{9}{4}\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is a solution to the given equation. Subtracting 7 from each side of the equation \\(8x+7=-25\\) yields \\(8x=-32\\). Dividing each side of this equation by 8 yields \\(x = -4\\). Therefore, the given equation has two solutions, \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) and -4. Since \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is positive, it follows that \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is the positive solution to the given equation.\nAlternate approach: Adding \\(4x^2\\) and \\(7x\\) to each side of the given equation yields \\(0= 4x^2 + 7x-36\\). The right-hand side of this equation can be rewritten as \\(4x^2+16x-9x-36\\). Factoring out the common factor of 4x from the first two terms of this expression and the common factor of -9 from the second two terms yields \\(4x(x+4)-9(x+4)\\). Factoring out the common factor of \\((x+4)\\) from these two terms yields the expression \\((4x-9)(x+4)\\). Since this expression is equal to 0, it follows that either \\(4x-9=0\\) or \\(x+4=0\\). Adding 9 to each side of the equation \\(4x-9=0\\) yields \\(4x = 9\\). Dividing each side of this equation by 4 yields \\(x = \\frac{9}{4}\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is a positive solution to the given equation. Subtracting 4 from each side of the equation \\(x+4=0\\) yields \\(x=-4\\). Therefore, the given equation has two solutions, \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) and -4. Since \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is positive, it follows that \\(\\frac{9}{4}\\) is the positive solution to the given equation.\nChoice A is incorrect. Substituting \\(\\frac{7}{4}\\) for x in the given equation yields \\(-\\frac{49}{4}=-36\\), which is false. Choice C is incorrect. Substituting 4 for x in the given equation yields \\(-92=-36\\), which is false. Choice D is incorrect. Substituting 7 for x in the given equation yields \\(-245= -36\\), which is false.",

Substituting \\(6k+13\\) for x and \\(8k-29\\) for y in the equation \\(x = y\\) yields \\(6k+13=8k-29\\). Subtracting 6k from both sides of this equation yields \\(13=2k-29\\). Adding 29 to both sides of this equation yields \\(42 = 2k\\), or \\(2k = 42\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields \\(k = 21\\). It's given that lines m and n are parallel, and the figure shows that lines m and n are intersected by a transversal, line t. If two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, then the same-side interior angles are supplementary.

Therefore, the value of the constant \\(p\\) is one that results in a false equation.

Since the coefficient of the \\(x^2\\)-term is positive, the graph of \\(y = f(x)\\) in the xy-plane opens upward and reaches its minimum value at its vertex. The x-coordinate of the vertex is the value of \\(x\\) such that \\(f(x)\\) reaches its minimum. For an equation in the form \\(f(x)=ax^2+bx+c\\), where \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) are constants, the x-coordinate of the vertex is \\(-\\frac{b}{2a}\\). For the equation \\(f(x)=x^2 +3x-130\\), \\(a=1\\), \\(b=3\\), and \\(c=-130\\). It follows that the x-coordinate of the vertex is \\(-\\frac{3}{2(1)}\\), or \\(-\\frac{3}{2}\\).

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 15/17. It's given that angle J is the right angle in triangle JKL. Therefore, the acute angles of triangle JKL are angle K and angle L. The hypotenuse of a right triangle is the side opposite its right angle. Therefore, the hypotenuse of triangle JKL is side KL. The cosine of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the side adjacent to the angle to the length of the hypotenuse. It's given that \\(cos(K) = \\frac{8}{17}\\). This can be written as \\(cos(K)=\\frac{JK}{KL}\\). Since the cosine of angle K is a ratio, it follows that the length of the side adjacent to angle K is \\(8n\\) and the length of the hypotenuse is \\(17n\\), where \\(n\\) is a constant. Therefore, \\(JK =8n\\) and \\(KL=17n\\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. For triangle JKL, it follows that \\((JK)^2 +(JL)^2 = (KL)^2\\). Substituting \\(8n\\) for JK and \\(17n\\) for KL yields \\((8n)^2 +(JL)^2 = (17n)^2\\). This is equivalent to \\(64n^2 + (JL)^2 = 289n^2\\). Subtracting \\(64n^2\\) from each side of this equation yields \\((JL)^2 = 225n^2\\). Taking the square root of each side of this equation yields \\(JL = 15n\\). Since \\(cos(L)=\\frac{JL}{KL}\\), it follows that \\(cos(L)=\\frac{15n}{17n}\\), which can be rewritten as \\(cos(L) = \\frac{15}{17}\\).

Therefore, the median of data set B is greater than the median of data set A, and the range of data set B is equal to the range of data set A.\n\nChoice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice B is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors. Choice D is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.",

      "explanation": "Choice D is correct. The graph in the xy-plane of an equation of the form \\((x-h)^2+(y-k)^2 = r^2\\) is a circle with center \\((h, k)\\) and a radius of length \\(r\\). It's given that circle A is represented by \\(x^2 +(y-1)^2 = 49\\), which can be rewritten as \\(x^2+(y-1)^2 = 7^2\\). Therefore, circle A has center \\((0, 1)\\) and a radius of length 7. Shifting circle A down two units is a rigid vertical translation of circle A that does not change its size or shape. Since circle B is obtained by shifting circle A down two units, it follows that circle B has the same radius as circle A, and for each point \\((x, y)\\) on circle A, the point \\((x, y−2)\\) lies on circle B. Moreover, if \\((h, k)\\) is the center of circle A, then \\((h, k−2)\\) is the center of circle B. Therefore, circle B has a radius of 7 and the center of circle B is \\((0, 1–2)\\), or \\((0, -1)\\). Thus, circle B can be represented by the equation \\(x^2 + (y +1)^2 = 7^2\\), or \\(x^2 + (y+1)^2 = 49\\).\n\nChoice A is incorrect.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. Let \\(x\\) represent the side length, in cm, of each square base. If the two prisms are glued together along a square base, the resulting prism has a surface area equal to twice the surface area of one of the prisms, minus the area of the two square bases that are being glued together, which yields \\(2K-2x^2\\) cm². It's given that this resulting surface area is equal to \\(\\frac{92}{47}K\\) cm², so \\(2K-2x^2 = \\frac{92}{47}K\\). Subtracting \\(\\frac{92}{47}K\\) from both sides of this equation yields \\(2K-\\frac{92}{47}K−2x^2 = 0\\). This equation can be rewritten by multiplying \\(2K\\) on the left-hand side by \\(\\frac{47}{47}\\), which yields \\(\\frac{94}{47}K-\\frac{92}{47}K-2x^2 = 0\\), or \\(\\frac{2}{47}K −2x^2 = 0\\). Adding \\(2x^2\\) to both sides of this equation yields \\(\\frac{2}{47}K = 2x^2\\). Multiplying both sides of this equation by \\(\\frac{47}{2}\\) yields \\(K = 47x^2\\). The surface area K, in cm², of each rectangular prism is equivalent to the sum of the areas of the two square bases and the areas of the four lateral faces. Since the height of each rectangular prism is 90 cm and the side length of each square base is \\(x\\) cm, it follows that the area of each square base is \\(x^2\\) cm² and the area of each lateral face is \\(90x\\) cm². Therefore, the surface area of each rectangular prism can be represented by the expression \\(2x^2 +4(90x)\\), or \\(2x^2 +360x\\). Substituting this expression for \\(K\\) in the equation \\(K = 47x^2\\) yields \\(2x^2 +360x = 47x^2\\). Subtracting \\(2x^2\\) and \\(360x\\) from both sides of this equation yields \\(0= 45x^2 – 360x\\). Factoring \\(x\\) from the right-hand side of this equation yields \\(0=x(45x-360)\\). Applying the zero product property, it follows that \\(x =0\\) and \\(45x-360=0\\). Adding 360 to both sides of the equation \\(45x-360=0\\) yields \\(45x = 360\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 45 yields \\(x = 8\\). Since a side length of a rectangular prism can't be 0, the length of each square base is 8 cm.\n\nChoice A is incorrect and may result from conceptual or calculation errors.
