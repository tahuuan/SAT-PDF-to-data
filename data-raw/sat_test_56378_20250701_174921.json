      "explanation": "The question asks for a comparison of the means, or averages, of two data sets. One approach is to ballpark. Both data sets contain the numbers 3, 8, 8, 11, and 24. Data set S contains an additional, smaller number, so its mean will be less, which makes (C) correct. To solve mathematically, use the average formula \\(T = AN\\), in which \\(T\\) is the *Total*, \\(A\\) is the *Average*, and \\(N\\) is the *Number of things*. There are 6 values in data set S, so \\(N = 6\\). Find the *Total* by adding the 6 integers to get \\(T = 2 + 3 + 8 + 8 + 11 + 24 = 56\\). The average formula becomes \\(56 = (A)6\\). Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to get \\(9.3 = A\\), which means that the mean of data set S is 9.3. Repeat the same steps to find the mean of data set T. There are 5 values in data set T, so \\(N = 5\\). Find the *Total* by adding the 5 integers to get \\(T = 3 + 8 + 8 + 11 + 24 = 54\\). The average formula becomes \\(54 = (A)(5)\\). Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get \\(10.8 = A\\), which means that the mean of data set T is 10.8. Since 9.3 is less than 10.8, the mean of data set S is less than the mean of data set T. Using either method, the correct answer is (C).",

With an absolute value, the value inside the absolute value bars can be either positive or negative, so this equation has two possible solutions. To find the solutions, either set 7x + 14 equal to 49 or set 7x + 14 equal to –49. The question asks for the value of x + 2, which is equivalent to dividing 7x + 14 by 7. When 7x + 14 = 49, divide both sides of the equation by 7 to get x + 2 = 7. When 7x + 14 = −49, divide both sides of the equation by 7 to get x + 2 = −7. Either 7 or –7 is a possible value of x + 2.

      "explanation": "The question asks for the value of a constant that represents a decrease. The question is about the relationship between values, so plug in. Plug in 100 for the number of movies available in 2022 because 100 works well with percentages. \\textit{Percent} means out of 100, so translate 9% as \\( \\frac{9}{100} \\). Because the number of movies available decreased by 9% from the starting number of 100, take 9% of 100 and subtract it from 100. The result is \\( 100 - \\frac{9}{100} (100) = 100 – 9 = 91 \\). Thus, the streaming service has 91 movies available in 2023. This is the target value; circle it. Because the number of movies decreased from 100 to 91, (B) is a likely answer. To test it, plug in 0.91 for m. The question states that the number of movies available in 2023 is m \\textit{times the number of movies available in 2022}, so multiply the number of movies available in 2022, 100, by 0.91 to get (100)(0.91) = 91. This matches the target value for the number of movies available in 2023, so stop here. The correct answer is (B).",

      "explanation": "The question asks for the x-coordinate of the x-intercept of a graph that is a translation of another graph. When a graph is translated, or transformed, up or down, the y-value changes. Start by isolating y. Subtract 5x from both sides of the equation to get 3y = −5x – 8. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to get \\( y = -\\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{8}{3} \\). To translate this graph up 2 units, add 2 to the y-value. The equation of the new graph is \\( y = -\\frac{5}{3}x - \\frac{8}{3} + 2 \\). At this point, the best option is to enter this equation into the built-in calculator, then scroll and zoom as needed to see a gray dot at the x-intercept. Click on the dot to see that the coordinates of the point are (-0.4, 0). The question asks for the x-coordinate of the x-intercept, which is –0.4. It is also possible to solve algebraically by making y = 0 in the equation of the new graph and solving for x. This might lead to the decimal form –0.4 or to the fractional form \\( -\\frac{2}{5} \\), both of which will be accepted as correct. The correct answer is –0.4 or –2/5.",

Set this equal to the slope from the first two points to get \\( \\frac{n}{-9} = -\\frac{5}{12} \\). Cross-multiply to get (-9)(-5) = (n)(12), or 45 = 12n. Divide both sides of the equation by 12 to get \\( \\frac{45}{12} = n \\). Both numbers in the fraction are multiples of 3, so reduce the fraction to get \\( \\frac{15}{4} = n \\). The correct answer is (B).",

      "explanation": "The question asks for the number of solutions to a quadratic equation. One method is to use the built-in graphing calculator. Enter the equation without the “= 0” part to see a parabola, and then scroll and zoom to see how many times, if any, the parabola intersects the x-axis. There are two points of intersection, at \\((-0.5, 0)\\) and \\((2.5, 0)\\), so there are exactly two real solutions, and the answer is (B). To determine the number of solutions algebraically, use the discriminant. The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root sign and is written as \\(D = b^2 – 4ac\\). When the discriminant is positive, the quadratic has exactly two real solutions; when the discriminant is 0, the quadratic has exactly one real solution; and when the discriminant is negative, the quadratic has no real solutions. The quadratic is given in standard form, \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\), so \\(a = 4\\), \\(b = -8\\), and \\(c = -5\\). The discriminant is \\(D = (-8)^2 – 4(4)(-5)\\), which becomes \\(D = 64 + 80\\), and then \\(D = 144\\). This is positive, so there are exactly two real solutions. Using either method, the correct answer is (B).",

The equation of a circle in standard form is \\((x – h)^2 + (y – k)^2 = r^2\\), where \\((h, k)\\) is the center and \\(r\\) is the radius. Shifting a circle to the right 7 units does not change the radius, and all the equations in the answer choices are equal to 64, so focus on the center. Moving a circle left or right does not change the y-value. Eliminate (A) and (B) because the \\((y – k)^2\\) portion of the equation is different. To move a circle left or right, change the x-value. In circle R, \\((x – h) = (x + 3)\\), so \\(-h = 3\\) and \\(h = -3\\). Since the x-value of the center of circle R is -3, the x-coordinate of the center of circle S, which is shifted to the right 7 units, is \\(–3 + 7 = 4\\). Thus, the value of \\(h\\) in circle S is 4.

      "explanation": "The question asks for the density of a rectangular solid. Use the Geometry Basic Approach. Start by drawing a rectangular solid on the scratch paper as best as possible, and then label the length, width, and height as 1.1, 0.8, and 0.8, respectively. Other information about the concrete block is given, so use the units to determine what to do next. The question asks for the density in kilograms per cubic meter, and the question gives the mass in kilograms, so look for a way to find a value in cubic meters. Since the side lengths are in meters, the volume will be in cubic meters. Write down the formula for the volume of a rectangular solid or prism, either from memory or after looking it up on the reference sheet. The formula is V = lwh. Plug in the side lengths given in the question to get V = (1.1)(0.8)(0.8), or V = 0.704 cubic meters. The mass in kilograms divided by the volume in cubic meters equals the density in kilograms per cubic meter. This happens to be the formula for density, which can be written as \\(D = \\frac{m}{V}\\). Plug in the known values to get \\(D = \\frac{1,690}{0.704}\\). Divide the fraction on the right side of the equation to get D ≈ 2,400.57. The nearest whole number is 2,401. The correct answer is (C).",

      "explanation": "The question asks for the value of an angle on a figure. Use the Geometry Basic Approach. Redraw the figure on the scratch paper, and add the labels. When a line intersects two parallel lines, two kinds of angles are created: big and small. All the small angles are equal to each other, all the big angles are equal to each other, and any small angle plus any big angle = 180°. Angle q is a small angle, and angle r is a big angle, so they add up to 180. Since q = 10c – 11 and r = 15c + 41, add those expressions together and set them equal to 180. The equation becomes (10c – 11) + (15c + 41) = 180. Combine like terms on the left side of the equation to get 25c + 30 = 180. Subtract 30 from both sides of the equation to get 25c = 150. Divide both sides of the equation by 25 to get c = 6. Be careful: the question asks for the value of p, which is a small angle. Plug c = 6 into the equation for the other small angle, q, to get q = 10(6) – 11, which becomes q = 60 – 11, and then q = 49. Because p and q are both small angles, p is also 49. The correct answer is (B).",

The question asks for the value of q, which is not part of an x-term, so focus on the constants and ignore the x-terms. Distribute on the left side of the equation to get \\(–7q = -\\frac{35}{9}\\).

      "explanation": "The question asks for the value of a percent decrease given a function that represents a specific situation. The value of the function is decreasing by a certain percent, so this question is about exponential decay. Write down the growth and decay formula: final amount = (original amount)\\((1 \\pm rate)^{\\text{number of changes}}\\). The number of changes is given in terms of hours, but the question asks about the increase every 75 minutes. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so set up a proportion: \\(\\frac{60 \\text{ minutes}}{1 \\text{ hour}} = \\frac{75 \\text{ minutes}}{h \\text{ hours}}\\). Cross-multiply to get (1)(75) = (60)(h), or 75 = 60h. Divide both sides of the equation by 60 to get \\(\\frac{75}{60} = h\\). Reduce the fraction to get \\(\\frac{5}{4} = h\\). Now, plug in \\(\\frac{5}{4}\\) for h in the function to get \\(M(h) = 302(0.87)^{(\\frac{4}{5})(\\frac{5}{4})}\\), which becomes \\(M(h) = 302(0.87)¹\\). The amount of the isotope is decreasing once, so 0.87 = 1 – rate. Add rate to both sides of the equation to get rate + 0.87 = 1, and then subtract 0.87 from both sides of the equation to get rate = 0.13. The question asks for d%, which is the rate as a percentage, so multiply 0.13 by 100 to get 13%. The correct answer is (B).",

      "explanation": "The question asks for the mean, or average, of a data set. For averages, use the formula T = AN, in which T is the *Total*, A is the *Average*, and N is the *Number of things*. First, apply this formula to group X, in which there are 40 packages with a mean, or average, mass of 24 kg. In group X, N = 40 and A = 24. The average formula becomes T = (40)(24), or T = 960 kg. Now do the same for group Y, in which there are 110 packages with a mean, or average, mass of 9 kg. In group Y, N = 110 and A = 9. The average formula becomes T = (110)(9), or T = 990 kg. Now calculate the average of all 150 packages. The number of packages combined is given as 150, and the total of the masses of all of the packages is 960 + 990 = 1,950 kg. Therefore, N = 150 and T = 1,950. The average formula becomes 1,950 = (A)(150). Divide both sides of the equation by 150 to get 13 = A. The correct answer is 13.",
