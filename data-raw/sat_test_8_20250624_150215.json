        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Juarez. In this context, \"important\" means marked by significant work or consequence. The text indicates that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, became a certain kind of figure in Mexico's history. It then supports that claim by describing some of the \"many significant accomplishments\" from Juarez's long tenure in office. This context conveys that Juarez is a significant and consequential figure in Mexico's history.Choice A is incorrect because the text focuses on Juarez's role as the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community and on his many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office; nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was \"unpredictable,\" or tended to behave in ways that couldn't be predicted. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that Juarez was a particularly \"secretive\" figure, or that he tended to keep things private or hidden from others. Instead, the text focuses on things that are known about Juarez: that he was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, that he had a lengthy tenure, and that his many major accomplishments included consolidating the national government's authority and advancing Indigenous rights. Choice D is incorrect because the text focuses on the idea that Juarez, who was the first president of Mexico from an Indigenous community, had many major accomplishments during his lengthy time in office. Rather than suggesting that Juarez was an \"ordinary,\" or common and typical, figure in Mexico's history, this context conveys that Juarez was instead a notable figure.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the research that Lopes-Ferreira and her colleagues are conducting on the stingray species Potamotrygon rex. As used in this context, \"a substantial\" effect means an effect that is sizable or noteworthy. The text indicates that the researchers are seeking to determine whether there are \"considerable variations\" in the potency of stingray venom that are associated with variation in the stingrays' age and sex. This context suggests that the researchers want to find out whether stingray age and sex have a substantial effect on venom toxicity.Choice A is incorrect because there's nothing in the text that suggests that the researchers have been studying whether the stingrays' age and sex have \"a disconcerting,\" or an unsettling and disturbing, effect on the stingrays' venom. The text indicates that the researchers wish to determine if stingray age and sex cause large variations in the toxicity of stingray venom, not if the effect of age and sex is disconcerting. Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that researchers want to find out whether differences in stingray age and sex produce differences in stingray venom, not that the researchers want to find out whether age and sex have \"an acceptable,\" or a satisfactory, effect on venom. The text makes no mention of what would make an effect on venom toxicity acceptable and gives no indication that the researchers are interested in that question. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense in context for the researchers to be looking for \"an imperceptible,\" or an unnoticeable, effect of age and sex on stingray venom. The text says that the researchers are trying to determine if there are \"considerable variations\" in venom toxicity linked to age and sex, not that the researchers are trying to find effects that they can't perceive.",

The text indicates that ocean currents are powerful and make it difficult for marine animals to hide from predators and that kelp forests slow currents down to create calmer areas. In other words, kelp forests create a more tranquil environment.Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that kelp forests provide shelter for marine animals, meaning they create environments that are safer, not more \"dangerous.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text discusses how kelp forests affect currents in the ocean, and it isn't clear how an ocean environment could be \"imaginative,\" or full of imagination. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that kelp forests create a calm and safe environment, and an environment that is \"surprising\" would be characterized by unexpected occurrences, not calmness.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it logically and precisely completes the text's discussion of The Mule Bone, a play that Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes wrote together. In this context, \"collaboration\" means working together with someone to write a literary work. The text indicates that most writers prefer to work alone and that working together destroyed the friendship between Hurston and Hughes. This establishes that The Mule Bone is a relatively rare example of collaboration in literature.Choice A is incorrect because in this context, \"characterization\" would mean a literary work's portrayal of characters' psychological experiences and motivations, but the text doesn't discuss characterization in The Mule Bone specifically or in collaborative works more generally. Choice B is incorrect because in this context, \"interpretation\" would mean the explanation of a literary work's meaning or significance, but the text doesn't discuss how readers or critics have interpreted The Mule Bone; instead, the text discusses how the play was written collaboratively and how the writing process affected the two authors. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"commercialization\" would mean writing a literary work in such a way as to ensure its commercial appeal, but the text never discusses commercial appeal as a factor in the writing of The Mule Bone specifically or the writing of collaborative works more generally.",

      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of how Ofelia Zepeda has contributed to the field of linguistics. As used in this context, \"extensive\" means having a wide or considerable extent. The text indicates that Zepeda's many accomplishments in linguistics are varied, including teaching linguistics, writing poetry in more than one language, creating a grammar book, and co-founding a language institute. This context supports the idea that Zepeda's contributions to the field are extensive.Choice A is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda's accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. It wouldn't make sense to say that achievements as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute demonstrate that Zepeda's contributions in her field are \"pragmatic,\" or related to practical matters and not involving intellectual or artistic matters. Choice B is incorrect because the sentence presents Zepeda's accomplishments as a professor, poet and author, and co-founder of a language institute as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence. There's no reason to believe that the positive achievements listed demonstrate that Zepeda's contributions in her field are \"controversial,\" or have caused disputes and opposing viewpoints. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"universal\" would mean including or covering everything in a group. The sentence presents Zepeda's accomplishments as examples to support the claim made in the first part of the sentence, and it wouldn't make sense to say that these specific achievements—particularly as the author of a grammar book specific to the Tohono O'odham language—demonstrate that Zepeda's contributions relate to everything in the field of linguistics.",

Martha was just coming in from the garden with the strawberries, and with more flowers in her apron.

The text portrays Miss Pyne as awaiting the arrival of a carriage while Martha brings strawberries and flowers from the garden into the house. The text also describes the surroundings of the scene, stating that Miss Pyne looks \"stately and calm,\" the evening is bright and cool, and birds are singing in the garden as the sun sets. Then the last sentence states that the house was \"wide open to the long-expected guest,\" which strongly suggests that Miss Pyne's anticipation and Martha's activities were in preparation for the guest who is expected to arrive in the carriage. Thus, the text depicts the setting and conveys what these characters are doing as they await the arrival of their visitor.Choice A is incorrect because there is nothing in the text to indicate that the characters feel any worry about the guest's arrival. The text indicates that the guest was \"long-expected,\" but characterizing Miss Pyne as \"stately and calm\" conflicts with the idea that the characters are worried about the guest. Choice B is incorrect because the text describes a moment in time when two characters are awaiting the arrival of a visitor rather than an extended period over which characters could be seen changing. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text describes the activity indoors (Miss Pyne sitting calmly), it describes a higher level of activity, not stillness, outside (Martha bringing fruit and flowers and birds singing).",

Therefore, the overall structure of the text is best described as a description of the delivery of a letter followed by the portrayal of a character's happiness after reading the letter.Choice B is incorrect because the text indicates that the letter has been written; there's no explanation why another character hasn't written one. In addition, the text's description of Rinaldo \"in a melancholy posture\" suggests that he's sad and thoughtful, not that he's desperate to receive the letter. Choice C is incorrect.

      "question_text": "According to historian Vicki L. Ruiz, Mexican American women made crucial contributions to the labor movement during World War II. At the time, food processing companies entered into contracts to supply United States armed forces with canned goods. Increased production quotas conferred greater bargaining power on the companies' employees, many of whom were Mexican American women: employees insisted on more favorable benefits, and employers, who were anxious to fulfill the contracts, complied.

The text says that the increased production quotas of food processing companies during World War II enabled employees to make better bargains in exchange for their labor. The underlined portion presents an example of this increased bargaining power: employees requested more favorable benefits, and employers complied because they were under pressure to fulfill the demanding terms of their contracts. Thus, the underlined portion of the text elaborates on a claim about labor relations in a particular industry (food processing) made earlier in the text.Choice B is incorrect because there is no indication in the text that the economic factors that influenced food processing also influenced other parts of the economy; thus, the bargaining described in the underlined portion of the text cannot be called an example of a trend. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion supports the historical narrative of labor activism in food processing that is sketched in the text, instead of noting an exception to that narrative. Choice D is incorrect because while the underlined portion does discuss the demands that workers made in exchange for their labor, it does not discuss the identities of the workers.",

The text explains that up until Wang and his team's discovery, the only fossil evidence of mixopterids came from the paleocontinent of Laurussia. Wang and his team, however, identified fossil remains of a mixopterid species from the paleocontinent Gondwana. Therefore, the team's discovery was significant because the fossil remains of a mixopterid species were outside of the paleocontinent Laurussia.Choice A is incorrect. Although the text states that Wang and his team identified fossilized remains of a mixopterid species that lived more than 400 million years ago, it doesn't indicate that mixopterid fossils previously found by scientists dated to a more recent period than that. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text states that mixopterids are related to modern arachnids and horseshoe crabs, it doesn't suggest that the fossil discovered by Wang and his team confirmed that this relationship is closer than scientists had previously thought. Choice C is incorrect because the team's fossil established the presence of mixopterids on Gondwana, not on Laurussia. Moreover, the text only discusses the fossil in relation to the geographical distribution of mixopterids, not in relation to their evolution.",

The text indicates that although dusky sharks don't usually eat eastern oysters, they do consume cownose rays, which are the main predators of eastern oysters. An increase in the abundance of cownose rays in the region in response to a decline in the abundance of dusky sharks would directly support the researchers' hypothesis: a higher number of cownose rays would consume more eastern oysters, driving down the oyster population.Choice A is incorrect because a finding that there's an association between a decline in the regional abundance of some of dusky sharks' prey and the regional abundance of dusky sharks wouldn't directly support the researchers' hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. Although such a finding might help explain why shark abundance has declined, it would reveal nothing about whether the shark decline is related to the oyster decline. Choice B is incorrect because a finding that eastern oyster abundance tends to be greater when dusky sharks and cownose rays are present than when only dusky sharks are present wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that a decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region. The text indicates that the sharks prey on the rays, which are the main predators of the oysters; if oyster abundance is found to be greater when rays are present than when rays are absent, that would suggest that rays aren't keeping oyster abundance down, and thus that a decline in rays' predators, which would be expected to lead to an increase in the abundance of rays, wouldn't bring about a decline in oyster abundance as the researchers hypothesize. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that consumption of eastern oysters by cownose rays increased substantially before dusky sharks declined in regional abundance wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that the decline in dusky sharks has led to a decline in eastern oysters in the region.

The text indicates that the roots of the two plant species grow directly into quartzite rock, where hairs on the roots secrete acids that dissolve the rock. The researchers hypothesize that the plants depend on this process because dissolving rock opens spaces for the roots to grow and releases phosphates that provide the plants with phosphorus, a vital nutrient. If the plants carry out this process of dissolving rock even when the rock already has spaces into which the roots could grow, that would support the researchers' hypothesis because it suggests that the plants are getting some advantage—such as access to phosphorus—from the action of dissolving rock. If the plants don't benefit from dissolving rock, they would be expected to grow in the cracks that already exist, as doing so would mean that the plants don't have to spend energy creating and secreting acids; if, however, the plants create new entry points by dissolving rock even when cracks already exist, that would support the hypothesis that they depend on dissolving rock for some benefit.Choice A is incorrect because the existence of soil-inhabiting members of the Velloziaceae family with similar root structures to those of the two species discussed in the text wouldn't support the researchers' hypothesis that the species discussed in the text depend on dissolving rock. If other such members exist, that might suggest that the root structures can serve more functions than secreting acids to dissolve rock (since dissolving rock may not be necessary for plants living in soil), but that wouldn't suggest anything about whether the species discussed in the text benefit from dissolving rock. Choice B is incorrect because differences in the proportions of citric and malic acid secreted by the two species would be irrelevant to the hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock. There's no information in the text to suggest that the proportion of each acid has any bearing on the process of dissolving rock or on any benefits the plants might receive from that process. Choice D is incorrect because if the two species thrive on rocks without phosphates, that would weaken the researchers' hypothesis that the plants depend on dissolving rock partly because dissolving rock gives them access to phosphates. If the plants can survive on rocks without getting a vital nutrient by dissolving those rocks, then either the nutrient isn't actually vital for those plants or they can get the nutrient in some way other than by dissolving rocks.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of mosquito repellents. The text begins by explaining that many repellents work by using natural components to activate multiple odor receptors on mosquitoes' antennae, and that new repellents must be created whenever mosquitoes become resistant to older ones. The text then highlights a research team's discovery that EBF, a molecular component of a chrysanthemum-flower extract, can repel mosquitoes by activating a single odor receptor, Or31, that is shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. The text suggests that compared to the repellents mentioned earlier, a repellent that acts on the Or31 receptor would be more effective: by noting that all mosquito species known to carry diseases share the Or31 receptor, the text suggests that the Or31 receptor may be unique in this respect, meaning that a repellent such as EBF that acts on it would be more effective since it works on a single receptor shared by all mosquito species that carry diseases, rather than a combination of receptors that is not shared by all species. Once mosquitoes become resistant to EBF, it would therefore make sense for researchers to look for other molecular components similar to EBF that target the activation of Or31 receptors, since a single such component could also repel all disease-carrying mosquitoes.Choice B is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that EBF molecules are difficult to extract from chrysanthemums and that investigating alternative extraction methods would therefore be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, since that component targets the Or31 odor receptor shared by all species of mosquitoes known to carry diseases. Choice C is incorrect because nothing in the text suggests that researchers are unaware of the precise location of Or31 and other odor receptors in mosquitoes' antennae or that knowing this information would be useful for developing efficient and effective mosquito repellents. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should aim to identify molecular components similar to EBF, which targets the Or31 odor receptor. Choice D is incorrect because it doesn't logically follow that the discovery of one odor receptor shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes should lead to further research into which repellents might activate the greatest number of odor receptors. Rather, the text suggests that researchers developing new mosquito repellents should instead search for additional molecular components that, like EBF, activate the one odor receptor that is known to be shared by all disease-bearing mosquitoes.",

Coloration tends to be especially saturated in male birds' feathers, and because carotenoids also confer health benefits, the deeply saturated colors generally serve to communicate what is known as an honest signal of a bird's overall fitness to potential mates. However, ornithologist Allison J. Shultz and others have found that males in several species of the tanager genus Ramphocelus use microstructures in their feathers to manipulate light, creating the appearance of deeper saturation without the birds necessarily having to maintain a carotenoid-rich diet.

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Shultz's finding about male tanagers. The text explains that because carotenoids both contribute to deeply saturated feathers and offer health benefits, having deeply saturated feathers is usually \"an honest signal\" (a true indication) that a bird is generally fit. However, Shultz and others have found that certain male tanagers can appear to have deeply saturated feathers even if they haven't consumed a diet rich in carotenoids, thanks to microstructures in their feathers that manipulate light. If those birds aren't necessarily eating carotenoid-rich diets, they may actually be less fit than other birds that appear to have similarly saturated feathers; this suggests that a male tanager's appearance may function as a dishonest signal, or a false indication, of the bird's overall fitness.Choice A is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that some tanagers can signal fitness without consuming the carotenoids that contribute to fitness, thereby making those signals dishonest, not that tanagers can give honest signals of their fitness without consuming carotenoids. Choice B is incorrect because Shultz's finding suggests that the microstructures in certain tanagers' feathers can give a dishonest signal of fitness, not that the microstructures are less effective than actual pigmentation for signaling fitness. Whether the signal of fitness is honest or dishonest has no bearing on how effective the signal is: a signal is effective if potential mates behave as though it's true, regardless of whether it's actually true. Since there's no information in the text about how potential mates respond to the dishonest signals of some tanagers, there's no Choice C is the best answer.

The text indicates that in the Three Sisters system, maize, squash, and beans form a \"web of relations\" in which the crops interact in various ways. The text's description of these interactions—the bean vines growing on the maize stalks, the squash vines keeping weeds away, and the beans adding nutrients that the maize and squash use—provides context suggesting that this \"web of relations\" is intricate.Choice A is incorrect because describing the relationship among the crops in the Three Sisters system as \"indecipherable,\" or impossible to comprehend, would not make sense in context. Although the text presents the relationship as complex, the text's description of the role that each crop plays makes it clear that the relationship is well understood, not indecipherable. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the practical benefits that each plant in the Three Sisters system provides to other members of the system, showing that the relationship among the crops that make up the system is not \"ornamental,\" or mainly serving a decorative purpose.

The text sets up a contrast between the idea that baleen whale accessory spleens appear not to have a function and the research indicating that the accessory spleen may actually have a role in supporting the whales' diving mechanisms. This context therefore conveys the idea that the assumption that baleen whale accessory spleens are latent may be incorrect.Choice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the role of the accessory spleen is \"replicable,\" or capable of being reproduced. The text indicates that the role of the accessory spleen seems to have no function, but some researchers think it does have a role; the text doesn't address whether the role of the accessory spleen could or couldn't be reproduced. Choice B is incorrect because suggesting that the role of the accessory spleen is \"predetermined,\" or decided in advance, wouldn't make sense in context. Although the researchers may agree that the role of the accessory spleen or any other organ hasn't been determined in advance, the text focuses on the idea that the accessory spleen was thought to have been functionless but may in fact serve an active role for baleen whales. Choice C is incorrect because it's the opposite of what the context of the text is conveying. The second sentence of the text indicates that baleen whale accessory spleens may not be useless, not that they aren't \"operative,\" or functional.",

Therefore, the difrasismo's apparent obscurity can be resolved when considered in the proper cultural context.Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the two nouns used in a difrasismo are semantically equivalent; instead, the text indicates that the two nouns used in a difrasismo make up a single metaphor whose meaning is often intelligible only in the context of information supplied by Aztec ceremonial culture. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that there's a relationship between the formal function of the difrasismo and the difrasismo's intelligibility. Additionally, the text suggests that present-day readers who are familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture wouldn't find the difrasismo to be unintelligible. Choice D is incorrect because the text doesn't indicate that the frequency of difrasismo's use in Classical Nahuatl is a necessary feature of intelligibility: the text indicates that an infrequently used difrasismo would presumably also be intelligible to members of an Aztec audience who are sufficiently familiar with Aztec ceremonial culture.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most accurately states the main idea of the text. The text explains that economist Adam Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand was putatively (that is, widely assumed but not proven) intended to illustrate a robust model (a consistently accurate generalization) of how individuals pursuing their own economic interests can create broader benefits for the population. The text then emphasizes the lack of affirmative evidence for this idea by calling out the term \"putatively,\" and explaining that, according to Gavin Kennedy, Smith used the metaphor only once in his works, in reference to specific circumstances related to the now-outdated economic view known as mercantilism, and that the metaphor didn't garner much attention until economists in the twentieth century held it up as a paradigm (a theoretical framework in the field) and thereby implied that Smith shared some of their views on economics. By emphasizing \"putatively,\" the text implies that there is no independent reason to believe that Smith would agree with the metaphor's use outside of the specific context for which he wrote it and that, therefore, the twentieth-century economists who used it did so to support their own views without regard for the metaphor's importance to Smith's work.Choice A is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith's metaphor was largely ignored until some twentieth-century economists revived it and bolstered its status, the text suggests that the later economists used Smith's metaphor to self-servingly boost their own work while ignoring the original context in which Smith wrote it. Moreover, the statement in this choice fails to reflect the text's emphasis on Smith's limited use of the metaphor in his work. Choice B is incorrect. Although the text indicates that some twentieth-century economists altered the significance of Smith's metaphor, the text doesn't suggest that the metaphor is a \"useful model\" of how aggregate benefits arise from individuals' selfish actions, let alone that this usefulness is unaffected by taking the metaphor out of its original context. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text indicates that Smith's metaphor was intended as a model of how individuals acting in their own interest produce aggregate benefits and it was written within the context of the now-outdated economic theory of mercantilism, these points are subordinate to the primary idea in the text, which is that Smith's use of the metaphor was tightly constrained but twentieth-century economists ignored the original context so that they could use the metaphor to suggest, without support, that Smith would agree with their economic views.",

The table shows the approximate rates at which five languages are spoken and the rates at which those five languages convey information. Vietnamese is spoken at around 5.3 syllables per second, whereas Spanish is spoken at around 7.7 syllables per second, but the two languages convey information at very similar rates: Vietnamese at a rate of around 42.5 bits per second and Spanish at a rate of around 42.0 bits per second.

According to the table, Hungarian is spoken at around 5.9 syllables per second, which is faster than Vietnamese (5.3 syllables per second). Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that two languages are spoken the slowest and convey information the slowest wouldn't support the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they're spoken at different rates. Choice C is incorrect because it isn't true that the fastest-spoken language (Spanish, at 7.7 syllables per second) also conveys information the fastest: Spanish conveys information at 42.0 bits per second, which is slower than the 42.5 bits-per-second rate at which Vietnamese conveys information. Additionally, even if this statement were true, the assertion that the language spoken the fastest also conveys information the fastest has no bearing on the claim that languages can convey the same amount of information even if they're spoken at different rates. Choice D is incorrect because it isn't true that Serbian conveys information faster than Spanish does.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it accurately describes data from the table that support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion about bite force estimates. According to the text, Barrett and Rayfield believe that estimates of dinosaur bite force may be strongly influenced by the methods used to produce them-that is, that different methods may produce significantly different results. The table shows that the studies by Bates and Falkingham and by Cost et al. used the same estimation method (muscular and skeletal modeling) and produced similar bite force estimates (approximately 35,000–57,000 newtons and 35,000–63,000 newtons, respectively). The study by Meers, however, used body-mass scaling and produced a much higher bite force estimate (183,000-235,000 newtons), while the study by Gignac and Erickson used tooth-bone interaction analysis and produced a much lower bite force estimate (8,000-34,000 newtons). The fact that one method produced similar estimates in two different studies and that two different methods used in other studies produced substantially different estimates supports the idea that dinosaur bite force estimates are significantly influenced by the methodology used to produce them.Choice A is incorrect because it inaccurately describes data from the table. The table does show that the studies by Meers and by Cost et al. used different estimation methods and produced very different ranges of estimated dinosaur bite force, which would support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different estimates. However, the table doesn't show that the study by Meers produced the lowest estimated maximum bite force while the study by Cost et al. produced the highest. In fact, the study by Meers estimated a maximum bite force of approximately 235,000 newtons, which is the highest of all the estimated maximums. Choice B is incorrect. Although the data from Gignac and Ericson's study are accurately described, a single set of findings from one study using only one methodology can't show that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates, as Barrett and Rayfield suggest. Choice D is incorrect. Although the table shows that the maximum bite force estimated by Cost et al. was higher than that estimated by Bates and Falkingham, the difference is relatively small; in fact, both teams estimated a minimum bite force of approximately 35,000 newtons and a maximum bite force close to approximately 60,000 newtons. Because these findings demonstrate that a single methodology (muscular and skeletal modeling) produced similar overall results in two studies, the findings don't support Barrett and Rayfield's suggestion that different methodologies may produce significantly different dinosaur bite force estimates.",

According to the text, the researchers tested for this effect by first having participants look at either something known to be awe-inspiring (very tall trees) or something ordinary (a plain building) and then purposely spilling pens near the participants. The finding that participants who had looked at the trees helped pick up significantly more pens than did participants who had looked at the building would support the researchers' claim by demonstrating that the people who had experienced awe behaved more altruistically when the experimenter needed help than the other participants did.Choice B is incorrect because a finding about helpful participants using positive words to describe the trees and the building after the experiment was over wouldn't have any bearing on the researchers' claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior. The text doesn't address the use of positive words to describe things or suggest any connection between using such words and having experienced awe, so that behavior wouldn't serve as evidence that experiencing awe played a role in promoting helpful behavior. Choice C is incorrect because a finding that participants who didn't help the experimenter were significantly more likely than others to report having experienced awe whether they had looked at the building or the trees would weaken the researchers' claim that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior by suggesting that the opposite might be true-that experiencing awe is in fact linked to choosing not to act in a way that benefits someone else. Choice D is incorrect because a finding about participants noticing that the experimenter had dropped the pens wouldn't have any bearing on the researchers' claim about people behaving altruistically. Being aware of a challenge or problem isn't necessarily beneficial on its own and isn't the same as offering help, so the finding wouldn't support the idea that experiencing awe increases altruistic behavior.",

      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of the morphology (form and structure) of sea stars, a type of echinoderm. The text indicates that echinoderms have radially symmetrical body plans (symmetrical around a central point, usually in the form of a star), whereas most animals have bilaterally symmetrical body plans (symmetrical along an axis running from head to tail through a trunk). According to the text, sea stars are unusual echinoderms because, despite their radial body plan, they descended from known bilateral ancestors. This shift in body plan was thought to be a process of losing the genetic markers associated with the head region. The text explains that by comparing the genes of one sea star species (\\textit{P. miniata}) to those of a close relative, the acorn worm, researchers determined that instead, anterior (head) genes are active across the sea star's entire body, posterior (tail) genes are active in limited, peripheral locations of the body, and no trunk-related genes are active. This finding strongly suggests that, rather than becoming \"headless\" as they evolved from a bilateral ancestor, sea stars developed a body plan consisting almost entirely of a head region with a minimal tail region and no trunk region present.Choice A is incorrect because the text doesn't identify how any particular region of sea stars' bodies influences the layout of sea stars' radial symmetry. Moreover, the text indicates that the radial symmetry of echinoderms is \"usually starlike,\" not that a starlike layout distinguishes sea stars from other echinoderms. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't suggest that the idea that sea stars evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry is incorrect (describing the bilateral origin as \"known\") and doesn't address any body plans other than those with radial or bilateral symmetry. The text strongly suggests that rather than revealing something about sea stars' origin, Formery et al.'s findings contradict the assumption that the current body plan of sea stars is \"headless.\" Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that Formery et al. were able to make determinations about \\textit{P. miniata} sea stars' body plan based on the comparability of genetic markers between \\textit{P. miniata} and \\textit{S. kowalevskii} acorn worms. The text indicates only that little or no activity was observed in certain types of genes associated with body development in \\textit{P. miniata}, not that those genes turned out to largely differ from body-development genes in \\textit{S. kowalevskii}.",

Since it's given that j is a positive number, \\(4j+9\\) is not equal to zero. Therefore, multiplying both sides of the given equation by \\(4j+9\\) yields the equivalent equation \\(p(4j+9)=k\\). Since it's given that p is a positive number, p is not equal to zero. Therefore, dividing each side of the equation \\(p(4j+9)=k\\) by p yields the equivalent equation \\(4j+9=\\frac{k}{p}\\). Choice B is incorrect. This equation is equivalent to \\(p=\\frac{k}{4j+9}\\). Choice C is incorrect. This equation is equivalent to \\(p=k-4j-9\\). Choice D is incorrect.

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 182. Let s represent the number of small candles the owner can purchase, and let l represent the number of large candles the owner can purchase. It's given that the owner pays $4.90 per candle to purchase small candles and $11.60 per candle to purchase large candles. Therefore, the owner pays \\(4.90s\\) dollars for s small candles and \\(11.60l\\) dollars for l large candles, which means the owner pays a total of \\(4.90s+11.60l\\) dollars to purchase candles. It's given that the owner budgets $2,200 to purchase candles. Therefore, \\(4.90s+11.60l \\le 2,200\\). It's also given that the owner must purchase a minimum of 200 candles. Therefore, \\(s+l \\ge 200\\). The inequalities \\(4.90s+11.60l \\le 2,200\\) and \\(s+l \\ge 200\\) can be combined into one compound inequality by rewriting the second inequality so that its left-hand side is equivalent to the left-hand side of the first inequality. Subtracting l from both sides of the inequality \\(s+l \\ge 200\\) yields \\(s \\ge 200-l\\). Multiplying both sides of this inequality by 4.90 yields \\(4.90s \\ge 4.90(200-l)\\), or \\(4.90s \\ge 980-4.90l\\). Adding \\(11.60l\\) to both sides of this inequality yields \\(4.90s+11.60l \\ge 980-4.90l+11.60l\\), or \\(4.90s+11.60l \\ge 980+6.70l\\). This inequality can be combined with the inequality \\(4.90s+11.60l \\le 2,200\\), which yields the compound inequality \\(980+6.70l \\le 4.90s+11.60l \\le 2,200\\). It follows that \\(980+6.70l \\le 2,200\\). Subtracting 980 from both sides of this inequality yields \\(6.70l \\le 1,220\\). Dividing both sides of this inequality by 6.70 yields approximately \\(l \\le 182.09\\). Since the number of large candles the owner purchases must be a whole number, the maximum number of large candles the owner can purchase is the largest whole number less than 182.09, which is 182.",

The new data set consists of the weights of the 71 tortoises in the original data set and one additional weight, 39. Since the additional weight, 39, is greater than any of the values in the original data set, the mean of the new data set is greater than the mean of the original data set. If a data set contains an odd number of data values, the median is represented by the middle data value in the list when the data values are listed in ascending or descending order. Since the original data set consists of the weights of 71 tortoises and is in ascending order, the median of the original data set is represented by the middle value, or the 36th value. Based on the frequencies shown in the table, the 36th value in this data set is 17. If a data set contains an even number of data values, the median is between the two middle data values when the values are listed in ascending or descending order. Since the new data set consists of the weights of 72 tortoises, the median of the new data set is between the 36th and 37th data values when the values are arranged in ascending order. To keep the data in ascending order, the additional value of 39 would be placed at the bottom of the frequency table with a frequency of 1. Therefore, based on the frequencies in the table, the 36th and 37th values in the new data set are both 17. It follows that the median of the new data set is 17, which is the same as the median of the original data set. Therefore, the mean of the new data set is greater than the mean of the original data set, and the medians of the two data sets are equal.

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. For the function f, since the base of the exponent, 1.25, is greater than 1, the value of \\((1.25)^x\\) increases as x increases. Therefore, the value of \\(18(1.25)^x\\) and the value of \\(18(1.25)^x+41\\) also increase as x increases. Since f is therefore an increasing function where \\(x \\ge 0\\), the function f has no maximum value. For the function g, since the base of the exponent, 0.73, is less than 1, the value of \\((0.73)^x\\) decreases as x increases. Therefore, the value of \\(9(0.73)^x\\) also decreases as x increases. It follows that the maximum value of \\(g(x)\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\) occurs when \\(x=0\\). Substituting 0 for x in the function g yields \\(g(0)=9(0.73)^0\\), which is equivalent to \\(g(0)=9(1)\\), or \\(g(0)=9\\). Therefore, the maximum value of \\(g(x)\\) for \\(x \\ge 0\\) is 9, which appears as a coefficient in equation II. So, of the two equations given, only II displays, as a constant or coefficient, the maximum value of the function it defines, where \\(x \\ge 0\\).

Since the perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its sides, and the given triangle is equilateral, the length of each side is \\(\\frac{852}{3}\\), or 284, centimeters (cm). Right triangle AMO can be formed, where M is the midpoint of one of the triangle's sides, A is one of this side's endpoints, and O is the center of the circle. It follows that AM is \\(\\frac{284}{2}\\), or 142, cm. Additionally, triangle AMO has angles measuring \\(30^\\circ\\), \\(60^\\circ\\), and \\(90^\\circ\\), where the measure of angle OMA is \\(90^\\circ\\) and the measure of angle OAM is \\(30^\\circ\\). It follows that the length of side MO is half the length of hypotenuse AO, and the length of side AM is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) times the length of side MO. It's given that \\(AO=w\\sqrt{3}\\) cm. Therefore, \\(MO=\\frac{w\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) cm and \\(AM=\\frac{w\\sqrt{3}\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\) cm, which is equivalent to \\(AM=\\frac{3w}{2}\\) cm. Since \\(AM=142\\) cm, it follows that \\(\\frac{3w}{2}=142\\). Multiplying both sides of this equation by 2 yields \\(3w=284\\).

Data set A has a frequency of 1 for values 10 and 16, whereas data set B has a frequency of 2 for values 10 and 16. Standard deviation is a measure of the spread of a data set; it is larger when there are more values farther from the mean, and smaller when there are more values closer to the mean. Since both distributions are symmetric with an odd number of values, the mean of each data set is equal to its median. Thus, each data set has a mean of 13. Since more of the values in data set A are closer to 13 than in data set B, it follows that data set A has a smaller standard deviation than data set B. Thus, statement II is false.

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 46. It's given that O is the center of a circle and that points R and S lie on the circle. Therefore, OR and OS are radii of the circle. It follows that OR=OS. If two sides of a triangle are congruent, then the angles opposite them are congruent. It follows that the angles \\(\\angle RSO\\) and \\(\\angle ORS\\), which are across from the sides of equal length, are congruent. Let \\(x^\\circ\\) represent the measure of \\(\\angle RSO\\). It follows that the measure of \\(\\angle ORS\\) is also \\(x^\\circ\\). It's given that the measure of \\(\\angle ROS\\) is \\(88^\\circ\\). Because the sum of the measures of the interior angles of a triangle is \\(180^\\circ\\), the equation \\(x^\\circ+x^\\circ+88^\\circ=180^\\circ\\), or \\(2x+88=180\\), can be used to find the measure of \\(\\angle RSO\\). Subtracting 88 from both sides of this equation yields \\(2x=92\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 2 yields \\(x=46\\). Therefore, the measure of \\(\\angle RSO\\), in degrees, is 46.",

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 1.8. It's given that the regular price of a shirt at a store is $11.70, and the sale price of the shirt is 80% less than the regular price. It follows that the sale price of the shirt is \\( \\$11.70(1-\\frac{80}{100})\\) or \\( \\$11.70(1-0.8)\\), which is equivalent to $2.34. It's also given that the sale price of the shirt is 30% greater than the store's cost for the shirt. Let x represent the store's cost for the shirt. It follows that \\(2.34=(1+\\frac{30}{100})x\\), or \\(2.34=1.3x\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 1.3 yields \\(x=1.80\\). Therefore, the store's cost, in dollars, for the shirt is 1.80.

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. A system of two linear equations in two variables, x and y, has no solution if the lines represented by the equations in the xy-plane are parallel and distinct. Lines represented by equations in standard form, \\(Ax+By=C\\) and \\(Dx+Ey=F\\), are parallel if the coefficients for x and y in one equation are proportional to the corresponding coefficients in the other equation, meaning \\(\\frac{A}{D}=\\frac{B}{E}\\) and the lines are distinct if the constants are not proportional, meaning \\(\\frac{C}{F}\\) is not equal to \\(\\frac{A}{D}\\) or \\(\\frac{B}{E}\\). The given equation, \\(y=6x+18\\), can be written in standard form by subtracting \\(6x\\) from both sides of the equation to yield \\(-6x+y=18\\). Therefore, the given equation can be written in the form \\(Ax+By=C\\), where \\(A=-6\\), \\(B=1\\), and \\(C=18\\). The equation in choice B, \\(-6x+y=22\\), is written in the form \\(Dx+Ey=F\\), where \\(D=-6\\), \\(E=1\\), and \\(F=22\\). Therefore, \\(\\frac{D}{A}=\\frac{-6}{-6}=1\\); \\(\\frac{E}{B}=\\frac{1}{1}=1\\); and \\(\\frac{F}{C}=\\frac{22}{18}\\). Since \\(\\frac{D}{A}=1\\), \\(\\frac{E}{B}=1\\), and \\(\\frac{F}{C}\\) is not equal to 1, it follows that the given equation and the equation \\(-6x+y=22\\) are parallel and distinct. Therefore, a system of two linear equations consisting of the given equation and the equation \\(-6x+y=22\\) has no solution. Thus, the equation in choice B could be the second equation in the system. Choice A is incorrect. The equation \\(-6x+y=18\\) and the given equation represent the same line in the xy-plane. Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have infinitely many solutions, rather than no solution. Choice C is incorrect.

Therefore, a system of these linear equations would have exactly one solution, rather than no solution. Choice D is incorrect.
