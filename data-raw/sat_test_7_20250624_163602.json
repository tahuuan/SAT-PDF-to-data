      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a prediction about a kilonova. In this context, a \"theory\" is an explanation that is considered scientifically acceptable. The text states that astronomers predicted in the 1990s that a collision between a black hole and a neutron star or between two neutron stars could release a massive gamma ray burst called a kilonova, explaining that they determined this possibility based on their extensive work with existing data and simulations (\"calculations and models\"). In other words, the prediction was a theory—a well-supported explanation-that, as the text indicates, was later confirmed with observations in 2017.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and a prediction of an event isn't \"evidence,\" or proof, of that event's existence, even when the prediction is based on extensive study. Further, there would be no need for later confirmation of something that was already recognized as evidence. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, a \"constant\" is a situation or factor that doesn't change. The text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017, and there is no reason to describe the prediction as a constant because the text doesn't suggest that the prediction was completely unchanged over time-it addresses only the making of the prediction and its later confirmation. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that it is the prediction made by astronomers in the 1990s that was confirmed in 2017; although a prediction might be informed by an \"experiment,\" or a controlled test, a prediction is an idea rather than a test.",

Muir states that the water beneath the boat \"was so clear that it was almost invisible,\" suggesting that those on the boat were able to see through the water and easily observe plants and fish below the surface.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. In some contexts \"clear\" can mean \"simple,\" or uncomplicated, but Muir is describing the water, and water isn't typically described as either simple or complicated. Muir emphasizes the water's transparency, not its simplicity. Choice B is incorrect. In some contexts \"clear\" can mean \"understandable,\" or reasonable or easily comprehended, but Muir is describing the water, and it doesn't make much sense to describe water as understandable. Muir emphasizes the water's transparency, not how easily the water can be understood. Choice C is incorrect. Although \"clear\" can mean \"obvious,\" or easily seen or understood, in some contexts, Muir's description emphasizes that the water \"was almost invisible\" and that the boat seemed to be \"sustained in the air,\" suggesting that the water was almost impossible to see, not that it was obvious.",

In this context, \"rectify\" means to correct or remedy something undesirable. The text indicates that by chartering the St. Luke Penny Savings Bank in 1903, Walker took action to provide local Black residents with greater access to financial services like home loans and savings opportunities. This context supports the idea that she aimed to rectify the undesirable situation affecting these residents.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because in this context, \"prolong\" would mean to lengthen something in time. The text indicates that at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, were faced with a lack of formal banking options. The text then states that Walker founded a new bank that provided these residents with financial services. Therefore, instead of prolonging the situation, she took steps to rectify, or correct, it. Choice C is incorrect because in this context, \"retain\" would mean to continue to have or to keep something. According to the text, at the turn of the twentieth century, Black residents in Richmond, Virginia, had few formal banking options, and Walker chartered a new institution to provide these residents with expanded financial services; therefore, she took steps to rectify, not retain, the situation. Choice D is incorrect because in this context, \"highlight\" would mean to emphasize or call attention to something, but the text indicates that Walker took concrete steps beyond merely drawing attention to the situation Black residents were facing in Richmond, Virginia, at the turn of the twentieth century. According to the text, Walker worked to rectify, or correct, the lack of formal banking options that were available to these residents by establishing a bank that provided them with home loans and savings opportunities.",

      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of a relationship between the results of randomized clinical tests of how effective common medical interventions are and the conclusions practitioners reach about such interventions in real-world settings. In this context, \"corroborate\" means confirm or support with evidence. The text indicates that one possible explanation for the relationship being discussed is that practitioners may overlook confounding variables-that is, additional factors other than the medical interventions being investigated that affect the observed outcomes. This means that practitioners may assume that an outcome is the direct result of a medical intervention when it is actually the result of a combination of factors. Clinical trials take steps to rule out factors other than the one being studied, so if those extra factors are actually having an effect on real-world outcomes, the trials are likely to produce conclusions different from those practitioners reach in their real-world observations. In other words, clinical trials may fail to corroborate practitioners' conclusions.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"circumvent,\" or find a way around or bypass, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; it's possible that researchers conducting the trials might avoid engaging with practitioners' conclusions, but findings from a study can't choose to get around something. Choice C is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"disseminate,\" or spread widely, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might choose to draw attention to practitioners' conclusions, but findings from a study can't spread anything. Choice D is incorrect because it wouldn't make sense to say that the results of clinical trials could \"implement,\" or put into effect, conclusions practitioners reach in real-world scenarios with patients; the researchers conducting the trials might consider practitioners' conclusions, but findings from a study can't put anything into effect.",

      "explanation": "Choice A is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of diadromous fish. In this context, \"demarcated from\" means separate or set apart from. The text indicates that diadromous fish differ from euryhaline fish in that diadromous fish \"migrate between freshwater and marine biomes during their life,\" whereas euryhaline fish do not relocate to a different biome because they can tolerate higher salinity environments. Therefore, this context suggests that because of differences between their migration patterns, diadromous fish are distinct and can be demarcated from euryhaline fish.\n\nChoice B is incorrect. Although the text states that diadromous fish migrate and relocate, the text does not suggest that diadromous fish would be \"reconstituted as,\" or formed again as, anything new. Only their environments change and not the fish themselves. Choice C is incorrect because the text does not suggest that diadromous fish can be \"conflated with,\" or combined with, euryhaline fish. Instead, the text distinguishes the two types of fish by pointing out their differences with regard to migration and tolerance for salinity. Choice D is incorrect because the text indicates that based on migration habits and tolerance for salinity, diadromous fish are different from euryhaline fish; so it would not make logical sense to say that diadromous fish would be \"derived from,\" or be an extension of or result from, euryhaline fish.",

Whereas the previous two sentences describe fires' ability to provide physical warmth to homes, the underlined portion focuses on the psychological comfort the fires offered. Choice C is incorrect. Although the text's second sentence mentions that fires were built in the summer because fog came in, which may have cooled the house, this detail isn't the focus of the underlined portion. Instead, the underlined portion indicates that fires were built for reasons beyond physical warmth: to create a sense of being home and safe.

The first sentence of the text introduces literary scholar Jeremy Douglass's warning to technology investors and enthusiasts against predicting the displacement of conventional books by newer media forms. The next sentence, which is underlined in part, presents Douglass's observation that interactive texts are hardly new; they have been available for longer than technologists assume, beginning with the first time readers wrote notes in texts' margins. Thus, the function of the underlined portion is to challenge the stance of the technology investors and enthusiasts mentioned earlier in the text. As the remainder of the text points out, newer media doesn't necessarily replace older media, but rather, as Douglass believes, leads to new forms of expression.\n\nChoice B is incorrect because the underlined portion challenges the position taken by investors and enthusiasts; it doesn't provide context for their claims. Choice C is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn't mention academics or compare them to investors regarding their ability to see potential in using contemporary interactive texts; instead, the underlined portion challenges the position of investors and enthusiasts who predict that conventional books will be replaced by newer forms of media. Choice D is incorrect because the underlined portion doesn't address technological challenges; instead, it disputes the stance taken by investors and enthusiasts, suggesting that conventional books haven't been displaced by traditional interactions with texts, such as writing in the margins, and won't be supplanted by newer forms of media either.",

The text states that the scientists concluded that the site is likely used only for reproduction because over three years they saw many adults, freshly hatched octopuses, and eggs but didn't see any juveniles. This suggests that the M. robustus octopuses that hatch at the Octopus Garden leave the site when they reach an intermediary state of development, returning only as adults for reproductive purposes.\nChoice B is incorrect because the text never discusses the stability of the M. robustus population at the site, only that the scientists observed 6,000 adults, hatchlings, and eggs there. Further, the text presents the site's temperatures as likely beneficial. Choice C is incorrect because the text doesn't provide any details about the eggs at the site and makes no mention of nests; it indicates only that eggs are present along with hatchlings and adults. Choice D is incorrect because the text makes no mention of the hatchlings feeding at the Octopus Garden, indicating only that the temperatures at the site are probably beneficial and that the site is likely used for reproduction.",

The narrator of the text indicates that the story about Hans Castorp will be told not because there is something particularly notable about him, since he is pleasant but \"perfectly ordinary,\" but because the story itself is remarkable (\"very much worth telling\"). The narrator then notes that there is a benefit in being at the heart of the story—that it is \"in Hans Castorp's favor\" that the story is his, and maybe uniquely so (\"not every story happens to everybody\"). Thus, the text suggests both that the story that will be told is a remarkable one that happened to an unremarkable person and that it is reasonable to argue that the person at the center of a valuable story takes on some of the story's value.\nChoice A is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text makes the point that \"not every story happens to everybody,\" the narrator doesn't state that stories are interesting simply because the people they are about are unique. Rather, the narrator suggests that one particular story is \"very much worth telling\" on its own and that Hans Castorp benefits from the fact that the story is remarkable and may be unique to him. Further, the narrator never suggests that the story will be hard to understand even though it is old. Choice B is incorrect. Although the narrator of the text suggests that Hans Castorp is of no particular importance, since he is a \"perfectly ordinary\" person, the narrator never reveals what makes the story of Castorp important, just that \"the story itself\" is \"very much worth telling.\" The narrator states that the story \"took place long ago,\" is \"covered with the patina of history,\" and can be told only \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past,\" but the story's age and the way it must be told aren't presented as reasons the story is important; the narrator is simply providing details about how the story will be told. Choice C is incorrect because the narrator of the text doesn't suggest that all stories about people who are \"perfectly ordinary\" (like Hans Castorp) must be told in particular ways to make it clear why those stories are consequential. Further, the narrator suggests that Hans Castorp's story must be told \"with verbs whose tense is that of the deepest past\" because it took place so long ago, not because telling it that way will convey the story's importance.",

The philosopher states that when Aristotle builds his argument about the characteristics of a well-functioning government, Aristotle asserts that transgression, or violation of law, will ruin the state if it \"creeps in unperceived,\" or goes unnoticed. The philosopher then adds that Aristotle illustrates this point by comparing the situation to one in which small but frequent expenses diminish a fortune almost unnoticeably until, eventually, the fortune is entirely gone. In other words, the philosopher indicates that Aristotle makes the point that total obedience to law preserves a healthy state while even small violations, if ignored, will undermine the health of the state.\nChoice B is incorrect because the philosopher addresses Aristotle's observation about corruption within the government (in particular, preventing the possibility that members of the government can take bribes), and although corruption can involve infractions, the observation is about a subset of people within the state and isn't directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law throughout the state. Choice C is incorrect because the philosopher discusses Aristotle's point about those who would intentionally destroy a constitution altogether and the need for rulers to remind the populace that it would be dangerous for a constitution to collapse, but neither idea is directly connected to the importance of upholding total obedience to the law. Choice D is incorrect because the philosopher explains that Aristotle makes the point that oligarchic leaders may retain power by having members of disenfranchised classes participate in government alongside governing classes, and this point doesn't address the importance of ensuring obedience to the law and addressing even minor violations.",

If novels published after 1880 contain significantly more references to activities occurring after 10 p.m. than novels from earlier periods do, this would suggest a change in human behavior and daily routines enabled by the availability of electric lighting. Before electric lighting—which provided illumination more easily than other available forms of light—many activities ceased after nightfall, so references to late-night activities would be less common in earlier novels. An increase in such references after 1880 would align with the researchers' conclusion, reflecting an increase in late-night activities made possible by electric lighting.\nChoice A is incorrect because a decrease in references to 10 a.m. after the year 1800 would not support the researchers' conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting toward the end of the 1800s. The time of 10 a.m. is in the morning and, in most places, characterized by daylight, so a change in references to that time would not be clearly linked to the impact of electric lighting. Choice C is incorrect because while an increase in implied time references relative to clock phrases in nineteenth-century novels could suggest a change in writing style or conventions, it does not directly support the conclusion involving a shift in human behavior prompted by the spread of electric lighting. The text indicates that the researchers' conclusion is based on the content of the time references themselves, not the phrasing used. Choice D is incorrect. If references to noon and midnight are used with roughly the same frequency in all the novels analyzed by the researchers, this would reflect a lack of change in human behavior with regard to time and therefore would not support the researchers' conclusion involving a shift in human behavior that occurred in response to the spread of electric lighting.",

According to the text, ULE is influenced by urban population growth and by gross domestic product (GDP) growth per capita. Reasoning that efficient national governments provide urban services and infrastructure needed to attract economic investment, Mahtta et al. suggest that, as governments become more efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure, GDP growth per capita will account for more ULE and urban population growth will account for less. But according to the graph, Region 1 saw an increase in the percentage attributed to urban population growth from 1970–2000 (between 60 and 65%) to 2000-2014 (between 70 and 75%) and a decrease in the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970-2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000-2014 (about 25%). Because the percentage attributed to GDP growth per capita decreased (the opposite of what Mahtta et al. claimed would happen if the governments had become more efficient), the data suggest that the governments of Region 1 became less efficient at providing urban services and infrastructure over that period.\nChoice B is incorrect. Neither the graph nor the text gives the regions' relative levels of economic growth or what effect Mahtta et al. would expect such growth to have. Furthermore, Mahtta et al.'s proposal suggests that Region 1's decline in the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita from 1970-2000 (between 35 and 40%) to 2000-2014 (about 25%) would suggest decreasing, not increasing, government efficiency over this time. Choice C is incorrect. Neither the text nor the graph provides information about the relative efficiencies of different governments in Region 2. Choice D is incorrect. Mahtta et al.'s proposal suggests that more efficient governments will have a higher percentage of their ULE driven by GDP growth per capita and a lower percentage driven by urban population growth. For Region 2, the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita increased from 1970-2000 (between 10 and 15%) to 2000-2014 (between 45 and 50%), but the opposite is true for Region 1, which saw the percentage of ULE attributed to GDP growth per capita decline over the same period. Thus, whereas the data suggest governments in Region 2 became more efficient, the data for Region 1 suggest that those governments became less efficient, not more.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it describes data from the graph that best support the student's assertion that initial efforts at trade liberalization in China were shaped by firms having limited capital (assets available for use) and that this situation resolved during the 2000s. The text explains that an approach to trade liberalization involves engaging in processing imports, one type of which doesn't require payment to a trade partner (processing with assembly) and one type of which requires upfront payment to a trade partner for raw materials (processing with inputs). The graph, which presents China's imports for ordinary imports and both types of processing imports in the years 2000, 2003, and 2006, shows that while processing imports with assembly rose from about 250 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 750 hundred million dollars in 2006, processing imports with inputs rose much more sharply, increasing from approximately 650 hundred million dollars in 2000 to about 2,300 hundred million dollars in 2006. Because processing with inputs requires firms to pay for materials (expending capital) and processing with assembly doesn't, the sharper rise in processing imports with inputs suggests that Chinese firms' assets—and thus their ability to engage in that type of processing imports—were relatively limited in (and before) 2000 and then substantially increased from 2000 to 2006. In other words, the data suggest that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.\nChoice A is incorrect because the graph indicates that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2006, not that processing imports with inputs were greater than ordinary imports and processing imports with assembly that year. Choice C is incorrect because the observation that ordinary imports were greater than both types of processing imports in 2000, 2003, and 2006 doesn't address a change within any type of imports from 2000 to 2006, and an indication of a change in that period that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s. Choice D is incorrect because the fact that processing imports with assembly were greater at the end of the period from 2000 to 2006 than processing imports with inputs were at the start of the same period doesn't address a change within either type of imports during the period, and an indication of such a change that might be related to the availability of assets is needed to support the assertion that the situation of having limited capital resolved during the 2000s.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Choice C is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Kristin Laidre's reasoning about the purpose of the tusk that many, but not all, narwhals have. The text explains that one group of scientists thinks the tusk may help narwhals detect the threat of freezing water and that Laidre disagrees with that idea, given the importance of avoiding a dangerous situation. It's logical to suggest that if the tusk serves such an important purpose for narwhals, the trait would be more common among them-specifically, that more narwhals would have a tusk.\nChoice A is incorrect because there's no reason to think Laidre would say that if the tusk has the important function of helping narwhals detect when the water around them is about to freeze (meaning that it isn't always freezing), some narwhals would choose a different habitat altogether. Indeed, if it's true that the tusk helps narwhals avoid areas with dangerous conditions when they occur in their Arctic Ocean habitat, the tusk would likely enable the narwhals to continue living in that habitat rather than drive them elsewhere entirely. Choice B is incorrect because the text focuses only on narwhals and makes no mention of other marine animals or how having a tusk might affect them. And if anything, it would be more logical to expect a very important trait to be more widespread, not less common, among other similar types of animals. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text describes narwhals as shy, it doesn't indicate that the scientists' conclusion has anything to do with shyness. And because shyness and detection of the threat of freezing water aren't logically connected, there's no reason to think that Laidre would expect narwhals to become less shy over time if the tusk serves that important purpose.",

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation": "Choice D is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of silicon carbide (SiC) fibers and creep, or deformation related to ongoing mechanical stress and elevated temperatures. The text states that Bhatt et al. found that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did. Because having a lower creep rate means that the material is slower to deform with exposure to stress, as the text explains, this finding suggests that aerospace composites made with the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber may be able to withstand mechanical stress for a longer period than those made with the other two polymer-derived SiC fibers can.\nChoice A is incorrect because it overstates the implications of the study's findings, which have to do with the rate of a material's deformation under stress, not the absolute degree of deformation. The text states that Bhatt et al. observed that a nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than two polymer-derived SiC fibers did, meaning only that it deformed more slowly over time under constant stress, not that it underwent less deformation overall. Choice B is incorrect because the text doesn't establish any similarity between the two polymer-derived SiC fibers other than that both had a higher creep rate than the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber did in Bhatt et al.'s study. Moreover, reducing a material's resistance to creep would mean that the material becomes more susceptible to deformation with exposure to stress and elevated temperatures, which would be expected to shorten rather than prolong the lifespan of machinery made with that material. Choice C is incorrect because the text suggests that the stability of aerospace equipment may be better improved by composites containing nitrogen-treated SiC fiber than by composites containing the two polymer-derived SiC fibers, not the other way around. The text indicates that Bhatt et al. observed that the nitrogen-treated SiC fiber had a lower minimum creep rate than the other two fibers did, meaning that it was slower to degrade under exposure to mechanical stress and elevated temperatures—suggesting that it may remain stable for longer periods.",

The placement of the noun phrase \"a contest\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the contest wanted to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Alaska Purchase. Choice B is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier. The placement of the noun phrase \"an award of $300\" immediately after the modifying phrase illogically suggests that the award of $300 wanted to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Alaska Purchase. Choice C is incorrect because it results in a dangling modifier.

Text 1 discusses the lack of knowledge of how plate tectonics on Earth began. Text 1 also mentions researchers who contend that movements of tectonic plates began around 3 billion years ago. As support for this assertion, these researchers cite computer models (which are simulations, not empirical evidence) of the temperature in Earth's mantle that show that at that time, the mantle would have been sufficiently molten for plates to move. However, the author of Text 2 asserts that empirical evidence from the geological record is necessary to make plausible claims about when tectonic movement began. Text 2 mentions an analysis performed by Wriju Chowdhury and his team of the geochemistry of zircon crystals (which would constitute empirical evidence). Chowdhury and his team argue, based on this analysis, that tectonic plates may have begun to move as early as 4.2 billion years ago. Therefore, since the author of Text 2 would consider Chowdhury et al.'s empirical evidence to be more conclusive than the computer models cited in Text 1, the author of Text 2 would most likely assert that a more definitive form of evidence than the computer models suggests a different timeline for the onset of plate tectonics on Earth.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the author of Text 2 makes no claims about the temperature of Earth's mantle and therefore wouldn't argue that the temperature of Earth's mantle 3 billion years ago was insufficient to allow tectonic movement. Choice B is incorrect because the author of Text 2 claims that empirical evidence is needed to fix the earliest date of tectonic movement. Computer models are simulations, not empirical evidence, so the author of Text 2 wouldn't distinguish between different kinds of computer models but would instead argue that no computer models can reliably predict the onset of plate tectonics. Choice C is incorrect because the author of Text 2 wouldn't consider any computer model to be able to provide evidence to support a plausible claim about tectonic movement, no matter how much such models were improved.

According to the text, this tree species produces latex, which is used to make rubber, and its inner bark contains a \"network of tubes\" that, when cut, enables the latex to flow out. The text explicitly states that this feature of Hevea brasiliensis is \"helpful for the process of making rubber.\"\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text doesn't mention the quality of the rubber produced from the latex of Hevea brasiliensis or compare its quality to that of rubber produced from other sources. Choice C is incorrect because the text never discusses the climates in which Hevea brasiliensis grows. Moreover, the text mentions only one region where this tree is found: the Amazon rainforest. Choice D is incorrect. Because the text states that Hevea brasiliensis is the world's \"main source of natural rubber,\" it can be inferred that there is at least one other source. However, the text doesn't specify whether that other source is also a tree species and, if so, whether that species grows in the Amazon rainforest.",

If mantle-derived rocks younger than 3.2 billion years contain material not found in older mantle-derived rocks, that material must have originated somewhere other than the mantle.

The text explains that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family descended from a single language (believed to have originated in what is now the US Southwest), resulting in similarities across the family's languages; however, the branches don't have similar vocabulary for maize, even though maize has been cultivated by all Uto-Aztecan tribes. The text also indicates that maize originated in Mexico and spread northward into what is now the US Southwest—the area where the Uto-Aztecan language family originated. It follows, then, that the language family had already divided into northern and southern branches before maize reached that area; if maize had been present before the division occurred, the family's origin language would have had terminology for it that likely would have been reflected in the branches, meaning they would have had similar vocabulary for maize. If maize arrived after the division occurred, however, the tribes in the two regions likely would have developed vocabulary pertaining to maize separately, at the times when they acquired the crop.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to how some Uto-Aztecan tribes obtained maize wouldn't directly address the role of language. Moreover, if northern Uto-Aztecan tribes had acquired maize from a southern Uto-Aztecan tribe, it's reasonable to assume that the northern tribes might have also picked up southern Uto-Aztecan terminology for maize in that exchange. Choice B is incorrect because the text discusses the fact that the northern and southern branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family don't have shared vocabulary pertaining to maize, not the idea that there are variations in such vocabulary within each branch—that is, the text focuses on differences between the two branches, not on differences between languages within a branch. Choice C is incorrect because the text focuses on vocabulary pertaining to maize in the branches of the Uto-Aztecan language family, and referring only to the timing and source of maize acquisition wouldn't directly address the role of language. Furthermore, the text implies that southern Uto-Aztecan tribes probably acquired maize before the northern tribes did, given the evidence that maize originated in Mexico—the location of the best-known representative of the southern branch of the Uto-Aztecan language family—before spreading to the north.",

The text states that data gathered by the Curiosity rover suggest that bodies of water deposited sediment on Mars's surface long ago. The text goes on to say that studying the sediment, Rivera-Hernández et al. found some coarse grains they believe are sandstone, which tends to be left by flowing water, and many more fine grains they believe are mudstone, which tends to slowly sink in low-flow water. The text further indicates that the researchers noted cracks in the fine grains that suggest there were cycles of desiccation, or drying, at the site. Taken together, this information suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) existed at the site for a prolonged period but occasionally experienced drying and that there were periods in which one or more streams (flowing water) were present, since the extended existence of a lake would account for the abundance of fine grains, periods of drying would account for the cracks in the fine grains, and periods with streams would account for the sections of coarse grains.\n\nChoice A is incorrect because the text indicates that an abundance of fine grains of sediment was found at the Murray Formation site, which suggests that a low-flow water source (such as a lake) was present. Further, the text makes no mention of where the water at the site may have originated from. Choice C is incorrect because the evidence described in the text doesn't support the idea that there were streams at the Murray Formation for an extended period and a lake for just a short time. The abundance of fine grains suggests that a lake (a body of low-flow water) was present for an extended time, not just a short time, and the sections of coarse grains suggest that one or more streams (bodies of flowing water) were intermittently present while the lake existed, not at a separate time. Choice D is incorrect. Although the text suggests that both a low-flow body of water (such as a lake) and flowing water (such as streams) existed at the Murray Formation site, meaning that there could have been a stream-fed lake, the text explains that the fine grains that signify the presence of a lake exhibit cracking that indicates periods of desiccation, or drying, which suggests that a lake was present but did occasionally dry out.",

Because coins with a silver content below 80% were widely considered unsuitable for trade, Elayi et al. speculate that a crisis in confidence in the currency occurred in Sidon around 367 BCE, which was likely relieved—despite Sidon's persistent oppressive financial obligations—as a result of Baʼalšillem II's successor Abd'aštart I's decision to ______\n\nWhich choice most logically completes the text?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "Choice B is the best answer because it most logically completes the text's discussion of Sidonian coins. As the text explains, researchers determined that Sidonian coins were made of silver and copper and that from 450 BCE to 367 BCE, the percentage of silver in each coin decreased from 98% to 74.2% while the percentage of copper increased from 1% to 24.7%. The text indicates that because the coins containing less than 80% silver weren't considered suitable for trade (suggesting that copper was less valuable than silver) and looked different from coins containing more silver, the researchers suspect there was a serious loss in confidence in the currency in Sidon in 367 BCE when the copper content was high. It's reasonable to assume that it wasn't possible to boost confidence simply by devoting a greater amount of valuable silver to the currency, since Sidon was under significant and ongoing financial pressure; however, keeping the total amount of silver the same and reducing the amount of copper in the coins would have resulted in smaller coins with a higher percentage of silver. Therefore, it makes sense to suggest that Abd‘aštart I (the ruler after 367 BCE) likely restored confidence in the currency by deciding to keep the amount of silver in Sidonian coins consistent with that in coins minted in 367 BCE but to decrease the coins' weight.\nChoice A is incorrect because the text conveys that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon likely occurred around 367 BCE because the percentage of silver in coins had fallen below 80% (presumably because Sidon's financial pressures meant that less silver was available for currency), making the coins unsuitable for trade. Thus, announcing that the threshold for the percentage of silver in coins would be raised—that is, that coins would need to contain even more than 80% silver to be suitable for trade—likely would have worsened the crisis rather than relieved it. Choice C is incorrect because the text strongly suggests that a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon was caused by the proportion of silver to copper in the coins in 367 BCE, with 74.2% being too little silver for the coins to be considered suitable for trade; therefore, it's unlikely that minting coins with a similar proportion of silver to copper (that is, still around 74.2% silver) would have restored confidence, even if the coins were heavier. Choice D is incorrect because the text gives no indication that funding the mining of more copper would have relieved a crisis in confidence in the currency of Sidon. The text establishes that Sidonian coins that visibly contained copper weren't considered suitable for trade, so Abd‘aštart I wouldn't have wanted to add even more copper to them, and it's unclear how else copper mining would affect views of the currency.",

Therefore, \\(f(5)=15\\) and \\(f(a)=|-3a|\\). Substituting 15 for f(5) and \\(|-3a|\\) for f(a) in the equation \\(f(5) - f(a) = -15\\) yields \\(15-|-3a|=-15\\).

      "explanation": "Choice B is correct. It's given that t minutes after an initial observation, the number of bacteria in a population is \\(40,000(2)^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\). This expression consists of the initial number of bacteria, 40,000, multiplied by the expression \\(2^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\). The time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria to double is the increase in the value of t that causes the expression \\(2^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\) to double. Since the base is 2, the expression \\(2^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\) will double when the exponent increases by 1. Since the exponent of this expression is \\(\\frac{t}{790}\\), the exponent will increase by 1 when t increases by 790. Therefore, the time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria in the population to double is 790.\n\nAlternate approach: The initial number of bacteria in the population can be found by substituting 0 for t in the given function. This yields \\(f(0) = 40,000(2)^{\\frac{0}{790}}\\), or \\(f(0)=40,000\\). Therefore, the initial number of bacteria present in the population is 40,000, so the bacteria population will have doubled when \\(f(t)=80,000\\). Substituting 80,000 for f(t) in the given function yields \\(80,000=40,000(2)^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\). Dividing both sides of this equation by 40,000 yields \\(2 = 2^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\), or \\(2^1 = 2^{\\frac{t}{790}}\\). It follows that \\(1=\\frac{t}{790}\\). Multiplying both sides of this equation by 790 yields \\(790=t\\). Therefore, the time, in minutes, it takes for the number of bacteria in the population to double is 790.\n\nChoice A is incorrect. This is the base of the exponent, not the time it takes for the number of bacteria in the population to double. Choice C is incorrect. This is the number of minutes it takes for the population to double twice. Choice D is incorrect.

      "options": [],
      "correct_answer": "-13/2",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is -13/2. The value of x for which f(x) reaches its minimum can be found by rewriting the given equation in the form \\(f(x) = (x - h)^2 + k\\), where f(x) reaches its minimum, k, when the value of x is h. The given equation, \\(f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 15)\\), can be rewritten as \\(f(x) = x^2 + 13x - 30\\). By completing the square, this equation can be rewritten as \\(f(x) = (x^2 + 13x + (\\frac{13}{2})^2) - 30 - (\\frac{13}{2})^2\\), which is equivalent to \\(f(x) = (x + \\frac{13}{2})^2 - \\frac{289}{4}\\), or \\(f(x) = (x - (-\\frac{13}{2}))^2 - \\frac{289}{4}\\). Therefore, f(x) reaches its minimum when the value of x is \\(-\\frac{13}{2}\\). Note that -13/2 and -6.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.\n\nAlternate approach: The graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane is a parabola. The value of x for the vertex of a parabola is the x-value of the midpoint between the two x-intercepts of the parabola. Since it's given that \\(f(x) = (x - 2)(x + 15)\\), it follows that the two x-intercepts of the graph of y = f(x) in the xy-plane occur when x = 2 and x = -15, or at the points (2, 0) and (-15, 0). The midpoint between two points, \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\), is \\((\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2})\\). Therefore, the midpoint between (2, 0) and (-15, 0) is \\((\\frac{2 + (-15)}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2})\\), or \\((-\\frac{13}{2}, 0)\\). It follows that f(x) reaches its minimum when the value of x is \\(-\\frac{13}{2}\\). Note that -13/2 and -6.5 are examples of ways to enter a correct answer.",

      "explanation": "The correct answer is 1,660. It's given that a line intersects two parallel lines, forming four acute angles and four obtuse angles. When two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal line, the angles formed have the following properties: two adjacent angles are supplementary, and alternate interior angles are congruent. Therefore, each of the four acute angles have the same measure, and each of the four obtuse angles have the same measure. It's also given that the measure of one of the acute angles is \\((9x - 560)^\\circ\\). If two angles are supplementary, then the sum of their measures is 180°. Therefore, the measure of the obtuse angle adjacent to any of the acute angles is \\((180 - (9x - 560))^\\circ\\), or \\((180 - 9x + 560)^\\circ\\), which is equivalent to \\((-9x + 740)^\\circ\\).

The tangent of an acute angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the leg opposite the angle to the length of the leg adjacent to the angle. It follows that \\(\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ}\\). It's given that \\(\\tan X = \\frac{12}{35}\\) and the length of side YZ is 24 units. Substituting \\(\\frac{12}{35}\\) for tan X and 24 for YZ in the equation \\(\\tan X = \\frac{YZ}{XZ}\\) yields \\(\\frac{12}{35} = \\frac{24}{XZ}\\).

The length XY can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that if a right triangle has legs with lengths of a and b and a hypotenuse with length c, then \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Substituting 70 for a and 24 for b in this equation yields \\(70^2 + 24^2 = c^2\\), or \\(5,476 = c^2\\). Taking the square root of both sides of this equation yields \\(\\pm 74 = c\\).
